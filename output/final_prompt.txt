COMMENTS PROCESSING GUIDE — P2 & P3 Support
Version: 4.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Guide for parsing and interpreting company/vessel/person comments to 
  extract owner preferences (P2), cargo preferences (P3), and relationship 
  data (P9). Comments are free-text and use shipping industry shorthand.

================================================================================
P2 — OWNER PREFERENCES (from comments + system settings)
================================================================================

  Score range: [0, 15]
  DYNAMIC CRITERION: If no preference data exists → score = 0, max_score = 0

  DATA SOURCES (check ALL):
    1. Company comments (free text)
    2. Person comments (free text)
    3. Vessel comments (free text)
    4. System settings / structured preferences (when available)
    
================================================================================
P2 — NO DATA vs NEUTRAL vs MATCH/CONFLICT
================================================================================

  This is a critical distinction. Three different situations:

  SITUATION A — NO PREFERENCE DATA AT ALL:
    score = 0, max_score = 0 (excluded from total)
    
    When to apply:
    - ALL comment sources are empty (no text at all)
    - Comments exist but contain ONLY non-preference information:
      • Business descriptions: "israel trader", "greek owner", "family company"
      • Relationship info: "works with Bunge", "Cargill via Clarkson"
      • Contact notes: "speak with John only", "email preferred"
      • Vessel operations: "fast loading", "good cranes"
      • Company size/type: "small operator", "single vessel company"
    - System settings have no preference data
    
    reasoning = "No owner preference data available — criterion excluded."

  SITUATION B — NEUTRAL (comments exist with preference-relevant words but no
    clear match or conflict):
    score = 7.5/15, max_score = 15
    
    When to apply:
    - Comments mention regions/cargoes but ambiguously
    - "open for all areas" → neutral
    - "flexible on cargo types" → neutral
    - Generic trading descriptions without specific preferences
    
    reasoning = "Comments exist but no clear preference match or conflict."

  SITUATION C — CLEAR MATCH OR CONFLICT:
    Score based on degree of match (see score mapping below)
    max_score = 15

================================================================================
P2 — WHAT IS AND IS NOT PREFERENCE DATA
================================================================================

  ✅ IS PREFERENCE DATA (score P2):
    "spec med/bs" → specializes in Med and Black Sea
    "pref atlantic" → prefers Atlantic trade
    "no ukr" → avoids Ukraine
    "ok greece but pref turkey" → Greece acceptable, Turkey preferred
    "avoids west africa" → negative for WA cargoes
    "only med/bs" → exclusive preference

  ❌ IS NOT PREFERENCE DATA (do NOT score P2, use 0/0):
    "israel trader" → business description, not a preference
    "greek owner" → nationality, not a preference
    "family company" → company type, not a preference
    "works direct with Bunge" → relationship data (P9), not preference
    "good operator" → reputation, not a preference
    "single vessel" → fleet info, not a preference
    "fast fixer" → behavior, not a preference
    "DPA in Istanbul" → operational info, not a preference

  ⚠️ EDGE CASES — use judgment:
    "trades mainly med" → WEAK preference data, score 7-8/15 (slight positive)
    "always in BS/Med area" → implied preference, score based on match
    "never goes to atlantic" → this IS a preference (negative for atlantic)

================================================================================
P2 — PARSING PREFERENCES FROM COMMENTS
================================================================================
  
  Keyword patterns:
    "spec [region]" → specialization, score 12-15 if match
    "pref [region]" → preference, score 10-12 if match
    "ok [region]" → acceptable, score 7.5-9 if match
    "no [region/country]" → hard block, score 0 for that region
    "avoids [region]" → soft block, score 2-4
    "only [region]" → exclusive, score 13-15 if match, 0-2 if not

  Score mapping:
    Perfect match (spec + region match): 15/15
    Good match (pref + region match): 10-12/15
    Acceptable match (ok + region): 7.5-9/15
    Neutral (ambiguous data): 7.5/15
    Soft conflict (avoids but not "no"): 3-5/15
    Hard conflict ("no [region]"): 0/15, potential BLOCK

================================================================================
P3 — CARGO PREFERENCES (vessel/company comments)
================================================================================

  Score range: [0, 15]
  DYNAMIC CRITERION: If no cargo preference data exists → score = 0, max_score = 0

  DATA SOURCES:
    1. Company comments — may mention cargo specializations
    2. Vessel comments — may mention cargo types handled
    3. Vessel type — General Cargo, Bulk Carrier, etc.
    
  NO DATA RULE:
    If no cargo preference information is found in any source:
      score = 0
      max_score = 0
      reasoning = "No cargo preference data available — criterion excluded."
      offer_hint = null

  PARSING CARGO PREFERENCES:
  
    "grain specialist" → high score for grain cargoes
    "cement carrier" → high score for cement, low for grain
    "no dangerous goods" → block for IMO/DG cargoes
    "clean holds required" → vessel maintained for sensitive cargoes
    "bulk only" → block for breakbulk/project cargo
    "steel/timber regular" → specialization indicators

================================================================================
AI MUST NOT — CRITICAL RULES
================================================================================

  ❌ Never consider vessel AGE when scoring P2 or P3.
     Age is NOT a preference factor. Age belongs in P8 only.
     
  ❌ Never treat business descriptions as preference data.
     "israel trader", "greek owner", "family company" = NOT preferences.
     These go to 0/0 (excluded) unless combined with actual preferences.
     
  ❌ Never assign neutral (7.5/15) when data clearly supports match/conflict.
  
  ❌ Never assign neutral (7.5/15) when comments contain only non-preference info.
     If no actual preference keywords found → use 0/0 (excluded).
     
  ❌ Never treat absence of negative data as positive.
     "No comment about grain" ≠ "vessel is good for grain"
     
  ❌ Never mix P2 (region preferences) with P3 (cargo preferences).
     P2 = WHERE the owner wants to trade
     P3 = WHAT cargo the vessel can/prefers to carry
     
  ❌ Never infer preferences from vessel type alone when comments exist.
     Comments override vessel type assumptions.
     
  ❌ Never consider vessel class, P&I, or flag in P2/P3 — that's P2A/P8.

================================================================================
COMMENT PARSING PATTERNS
================================================================================

  ABBREVIATIONS commonly found in comments:
    spec = specializes           pref = prefers  
    ok = acceptable              no = does not accept / avoids
    w/ = with                    w/o = without
    dg = dangerous goods         imo = IMO classified cargo
    bs = Black Sea               med = Mediterranean
    waf = West Africa            eaf = East Africa
    cont = Continent (NW Europe) ukr = Ukraine
    tur / trk = Turkey           gre = Greece
    ita = Italy                  fra = France
    
  RELATIONSHIP INDICATORS (for P9, see MASTER_SCORING_SYSTEM.txt):
    "works direct with [company]" → direct relationship
    "[company] cargoes via [broker]" → broker relationship
    "exclusive [company]" → exclusive relationship, caution
    "broker for [company]" → intermediary relationship

  NON-PREFERENCE INDICATORS (use 0/0 for P2):
    "[country] trader" → business description
    "[nationality] owner" → nationality info
    "family company" → company type
    "single vessel" → fleet size
    "good/reliable operator" → reputation

MASTER SCORING SYSTEM
Version: 6.0 FINAL
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Central scoring framework for vessel-cargo matching. Defines all criteria,
  dynamic score calculation, priority order, P9 relationship check, and 
  offer opening generation logic.

================================================================================
VESSEL JSON FIELD MAPPING
================================================================================

  AI must use the correct fields from vessel JSON:

  VESSEL SPECS:
    DWT            → field "dwt"
    Max summer draft → field "draft" (NOT "max-draught")
    LOA            → field "length-overall"
    Beam           → field "beam"
    Year built     → field "year-of-build"
    Grain capacity → field "grain-capacity" (cubic feet)
    Class          → field "classification-society"
    Flag           → field "flag"
    P&I            → field "pi_information"
    Holds          → field "holds"
    Hatches        → field "hatches"
    Gear           → field "gear-details"

  AIS / POSITION DATA:
    Current draught → field "current-draught" (from AIS, meters)
    Destination    → field "destination"
    ETA            → field "eta" (ISO datetime)
    Speed          → field "speed"
    Nav status     → field "navigation-status"
    Position time  → field "position-received" (when AIS data was received)
    Current area   → field "vessel_current_area"
    Average speed  → field "average-speed"

  DRAUGHT ANALYSIS FIELDS:
    For draught ratio, use: current-draught / draft
    ❌ Do NOT use "max-draught" (this is max recorded, may include tropical)
    ❌ Do NOT use "min-draught" (this is ballast reference)
    ✅ Use "draft" = summer loadline draft from vessel specs

  COMMENTS / PREFERENCES:
    Vessel comments     → field "comments" (array)
    Company comments    → field "companies[].comments" (array per company)
    Person comments     → field "people[].comments" (array per person)
    OpenArea           → field "open_area" (string or null)

  PORT HISTORY:
    Vessel top ports    → field "top_ports.vessel" (array)
    Company top ports   → field "top_ports.company.items" (array)
    Both sources should be used for P4 scoring.

================================================================================
DYNAMIC MAX_SCORE CALCULATION
================================================================================

  ALWAYS ACTIVE (max_score is always set):
    P1  = 20
    P1A = 15
    P2A = 20
    P4  = 10
    P5  = 15
    P7  = 10
    ────────
    Base always-active MAX = 90

  DYNAMIC (max_score = 0 if no data, otherwise max):
    P2  = 15 or 0 (no owner preference data → excluded)
    P3  = 15 or 0 (no cargo preference data → excluded)
    P6  = 15 or 0 (no OpenArea comments → excluded)
    P8  = 20 or 0 (no restrictions set → excluded)

  FORMULA:
    dynamic_max_score = SUM of max_score for ALL criteria where max_score > 0
    
    Minimum: 90 (only always-active criteria)
    Maximum: 90 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 20 = 155 (all criteria active)

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  FINAL SCORE — ALWAYS EXPRESSED AS PERCENTAGE:                  ║
  ║                                                                 ║
  ║  total_score = ROUND((total_score_raw / dynamic_max_score)×100) ║
  ║                                                                 ║
  ║  total_score is a number from 0 to 100 (percentage).            ║
  ║  NEVER report total_score as raw points.                        ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

================================================================================
EVALUATION PRIORITY ORDER
================================================================================

  1. P8  — Restrictions Compliance (BLOCK potential — but NOT for age)
  2. P5  — Intake / Cargo Fit (BLOCK potential — includes draft restrictions)
  3. P2A — PSC Port Accessibility (BLOCK potential)
  4. P2  — Owner Preferences (BLOCK potential for "no X")
  5. P3  — Cargo Preferences
  6. P6  — OpenArea Comments
  7. P4  — Last Ports
  8. P1A — Regional Patterns
  9. P1  — Proximity (BLOCK for non-viable distances)
  10. P7  — Readiness / ETA (BLOCK for missed laycan)
  11. P9  — Relationship Check (warning only, no score)

  IMPORTANT: Even when a BLOCK is found early, score ALL remaining criteria.

================================================================================
CRITICAL — RESTRICTION SCOPE RULES
================================================================================

  P5 handles: Draft/draught restrictions, cargo quantity fit, cubature
  P8 handles: ONLY Class, P&I, IMO, Holds Type, DWT, Age, LOA, Beam
  P2A handles: PSC risk based on flag, class, P&I, age, port strictness
  P2 handles: Owner's regional preferences from comments
  P3 handles: Cargo type preferences from comments

  Draft restrictions → P5. NEVER in P8.

================================================================================
BLOCK LOGIC
================================================================================

  Any criterion can produce a BLOCK. A single BLOCK = vessel is not viable.
  
  When BLOCK is triggered:
    - recommendation = "BLOCKED"
    - Still score ALL other criteria
    - Mark blocked criterion with "decision": "blocked", "critical": true
    - short_summary explains why vessel is blocked
    - Offer opening IS STILL generated (see below)

  Multiple BLOCKs: Report all. Summary mentions the most impactful.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION CATEGORIES
================================================================================

  BLOCKED — One or more criteria triggered BLOCK
  STRONG (80%+) — Excellent match
  GOOD (65-80%) — Solid match with minor issues
  CONDITIONAL (50-65%) — Decent match, has concerns
  WEAK (35-50%) — Poor match but may work
  SKIP (<35%) — Not worth offering

================================================================================
P9 — RELATIONSHIP CHECK (WARNING ONLY)
================================================================================

  P9 is NOT a scoring criterion. It generates a warning flag.

  DATA SOURCES:
    - companies[].comments
    - people[].comments
    - vessel comments[]
    
  WARNING TYPES:

    DIRECT_RELATIONSHIP
      Trigger: "works direct with [charterer]"
      Offer impact: "in case you haven't seen this yet"
               
    BROKER_RELATIONSHIP
      Trigger: "[charterer] cargoes via [broker]"
      Offer impact: Owner may redirect to their broker.
               
    NO_RELATIONSHIP (CLEAR)
      Warning: null

  OUTPUT:
    "relationship_warning": { "status": "CLEAR" }
    or
    "relationship_warning": {
      "status": "WARNING",
      "type": "direct_relationship",
      "details": "...",
      "offer_guidance": "..."
    }

================================================================================
OFFER OPENING GENERATION — ALWAYS REQUIRED
================================================================================

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  Offer opening is ALWAYS generated, including for BLOCKED       ║
  ║  vessels. For BLOCKED vessels, use intent "blocked_info".       ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  See: OFFER_OPENING_STYLE_GUIDE.txt for detailed style rules.

  INTENT based on recommendation:

    BLOCKED:
      intent = "blocked_info"
      Purpose: Informational text in case broker decides to offer anyway
      (e.g., if laycan extends, if market changes).
      Tone: cautious, factual. Mention the block reason.
      Still generate email_text and messenger_text.
      Example: "We have below cargo which may interest you for mv Petrel S 
               post her current discharge — timing is tight for current 
               dates but pls keep in mind for any extensions."

    STRONG (80%+):
      intent = "attract"
      Confident, lead with strengths.

    GOOD (65-80%):
      intent = "attract" or "inquire"
      Proactive, show cargo + mention minor concerns.

    CONDITIONAL (50-65%):
      intent = "inquire"
      Balanced, ask key questions.

    WEAK (35-50%):
      intent = "inform"
      Cautious, gather info.

    SKIP (<35%):
      intent = "inform"
      For reference only.

  GENERATION STEPS:
    1. Determine intent from recommendation
    2. Extract selling points from high-scoring criteria (offer_hints)
    3. Extract concerns from low-scoring criteria (offer_hints)
    4. Extract questions from missing data
    5. Generate email_text (2-4 sentences, shipping English)
    6. Generate messenger_text (1-2 sentences, max abbreviations)

  RULES:
    - NO greetings in offer_opening text
    - Always use shipping abbreviations (pls, yr, mv, lmk, cld)
    - Reference vessel by name
    - For BLOCKED: mention what makes it blocked + what could change

================================================================================

OFFER OPENING STYLE GUIDE
Version: 2.0 FINAL
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Define the style, tone, abbreviations, and approach for generating offer
  opening lines. These are ready-to-use phrases for the beginning of an 
  email or messenger message to a shipowner about a cargo opportunity.

  IMPORTANT: Offer openings contain NO GREETINGS. Greetings (gm, hi, dear)
  are handled separately with personalization.

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗

TEMPLATES BY INTENT LEVEL
================================================================================

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  BLOCKED_INFO — vessel is blocked but we still generate an opening
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Provide a ready draft in case the block condition changes (laycan
  extends, owner changes mind, market shifts). Broker can decide to send
  or not. Mention the block reason honestly but keep it professional.
  Tone: Cautious, informational, diplomatic.

  BLOCKED BY TIMING (P7):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo for yr reference re mv [vessel]. We note 
       timing is tight given her current position, hvr sending in case 
       laycan extends or she frees up earlier than anticipated. Any 
       update on her schedule wld be appreciated."
       
      "Wish to draw yr attention to below cargo for mv [vessel] — we 
       understand current dates don't quite work but wanted to keep you 
       in the loop for any future adjustments. Yr update on her status 
       wld be welcome."

       in case laycan changes — any news on her schedule?"
       
      "[vessel] — nice cargo but timing is the issue. fyi in case 
       things shift. when does she free up?"

    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo details for yr good order re mv [vessel]. 
       We appreciate [region] may not be of primary interest, hvr wanted 
       to show given the cargo otherwise suits her well. Any change in 
       trading plans wld be good to know."
       
    Messenger:

  Goal: Show cargo + ask key questions to clarify fit.
  Tone: Interested but cautious, transparent about concerns.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo we'd like to show for mv [vessel]. We note 
     she's opening [area] — cld you kindly confirm her exact opening 
     date/position? Also wld be helpful to know yr view on [topic]."
     
    "Pls find below cargo for mv [vessel]. Position looks reasonable 
     but intake is tight — wld appreciate yr indication on qty

================================================================================
OPEN_AREA_COMMENTS_SCORING — P6
Version: 5.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Evaluate how well the cargo matches the vessel's stated voyage strategy 
  as expressed in OpenArea comments. These comments reflect what the owner
  or operator has communicated about their intentions, preferences, or 
  requirements for the next voyage.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 15]
DYNAMIC CRITERION: If no comments exist → score = 0, max_score = 0 (excluded)

================================================================================
CRITICAL — NO DATA vs NEUTRAL
================================================================================

  NO DATA (excluded):
    Comments field is empty or missing.
    score = 0, max_score = 0
    reasoning = "No OpenArea comments — criterion excluded."
    This removes P6 from the dynamic_max_score denominator.

  NEUTRAL (scored):
    Comments exist but don't clearly match or conflict with cargo.
    score = 7.5/15, max_score = 15
    reasoning = "Comments exist but no clear alignment or conflict."
    This keeps P6 in the denominator.

  These are DIFFERENT outcomes. Do not confuse them.

================================================================================
SCORING LEVELS (when comments exist, max_score = 15)
================================================================================

  FULL CONFLICT — score: 0/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner explicitly states they do NOT want what this cargo offers.
    Examples:
      - "looking for Med" but cargo is Black Sea
      - "no grain" but cargo is wheat
      - "needs min 20k" but cargo is 6,000t
    offer_hint: "Owner's strategy conflicts. Only offer if exceptional."

  SOFT CONFLICT — score: 3-5/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner's stated preferences don't match well but aren't hard blocks.
    Examples:
      - "pref Med/BS" and cargo is East Med (borderline)
      - Mentions different cargo type but doesn't exclude this one
      - "looking for long voyage" but this is short
    offer_hint: "Partial mismatch — emphasize what makes this attractive."

  NEUTRAL — score: 7.5/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Comments exist but don't clearly support or contradict.
    Examples:
      - Comment only mentions opening date/area, no preferences
      - "open for offers"
      - Mentions unrelated details
    offer_hint: null

  POSITIVE MATCH — score: 10-12/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner's comments align well with the cargo.
    Examples:
      - "open for BS/Med" and cargo is Black Sea
      - Mentions similar cargo type
      - "looking for short voyage" and this fits
    offer_hint: "Owner's strategy aligns — mention this in opening."

  PERFECT MATCH — score: 15/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner explicitly asks for exactly what this cargo is.
    Examples:
      - "looking for grain ex Ukraine" and cargo is wheat ex Chornomorsk
      - "need cargo to Sfax" and discharge is Sfax
    offer_hint: "Perfect match with owner's request — lead with this."

================================================================================
AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Read ALL OpenArea comments carefully
    - Compare against: cargo type, load/discharge region, quantity, timing
    - Score based on degree of alignment/conflict
    - Set max_score = 0 when comments are empty (excluded)
    - Set max_score = 15 when comments exist (even if neutral)

  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never invent preferences not stated in comments
    - ❌ Never score neutral (7.5) when clear match or conflict exists
    - ❌ Never give max_score = 15 when comments are empty
    - ❌ Never consider vessel specs here (that's P5, P8)
    - ❌ Never consider owner preferences from other sources (that's P2)
    - ❌ Never confuse "no comments" (excluded) with "neutral" (scored)

# CRITICAL: This file provides EXPLICIT scoring rules for P1A criterion
# AI must use these rules instead of making assumptions about trade patterns
#
# Maximum Score: 15 points
# Confidence Range: 60-90%
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

version: "2.0"
date: "2026-01-19"
priority: "CRITICAL - Regional patterns are complex and require explicit rules"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# OVERVIEW
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

purpose: |
  Regional trade patterns reflect:
  - Economic viability of vessel positioning
  - Availability of backhaul cargoes
  - Geopolitical restrictions (sanctions, war zones)
  - Cost structures (canal fees, ballast costs)
  - Historical trade flows and market practices
  
  AI MUST use explicit scoring rules from this file, not general assumptions.

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SCORING METHODOLOGY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

scoring_approach: |
  1. Identify vessel's opening region/port
  2. Identify cargo loading region
  3. Match pattern to scoring table below
  4. Apply vessel size adjustments if needed
  5. Consider special cases (Danube, Russian ports, etc.)

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# EXPLICIT SCORING TABLE - PRIMARY PATTERNS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

primary_trade_patterns:

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # BLACK SEA PATTERNS (Coasters & Small Handy)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  black_sea_to_marmara:
    vessel_opens: "Black Sea (POC, Danube, Constanta area)"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea"
    cargo_discharges: "Marmara Sea (Turkey)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster", "Small Handy"]
    score: 15
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      This is THE primary trade pattern for Black Sea coasters.
      POC grain/minerals to Turkish/Marmara ports is the backbone trade.
    examples:
      - "Chornomorsk → Yarimca"
      - "Odessa → Istanbul (Marmara)"
      - "Constanta → Derince"
      
  black_sea_to_mediterranean:
    vessel_opens: "Black Sea"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea"
    cargo_discharges: "Mediterranean (Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Israel)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Coaster", "Small Handy"]
    score: 14
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      Standard export route for Black Sea grain and minerals.
      Slightly less common than Marmara but still core business.
    examples:
      - "Chornomorsk → Alexandria"
      - "Constanta → Tripoli"
      
  black_sea_internal:
    vessel_opens: "Black Sea"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea"
    cargo_discharges: "Black Sea"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster"]
    score: 13
    confidence: 85
    reasoning: |
      Internal Black Sea trades - less common than export routes.
      Examples: Bulgaria to Romania, Georgia coastal trades.

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # BACKHAUL PATTERNS (High Favorability)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  aegean_to_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "Aegean Sea"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea (POC, Danube)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster", "Small Handy"]
    score: 12
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      STRONG backhaul pattern. Vessels commonly discharge in Aegean
      (Turkish Aegean ports, Greek ports) and return to Black Sea for loading.
      This is a well-established trade flow.
    examples:
      - "Aliaga → Chornomorsk"
      - "Piraeus → Constanta"
    citations:
      - "Correction: Aegean vessels commonly find backhaul to Black Sea"
      
  adriatic_to_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "Adriatic Sea"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea (POC, Danube)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster", "Small Handy"]
    score: 12
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      STRONG backhaul pattern due to LACK of Adriatic backhaul cargoes.
      After discharging in Adriatic ports (Italy, Croatia, Albania),
      vessels commonly ballast to Black Sea as there are limited 
      outbound cargoes from Adriatic region.
    examples:
      - "Rijeka → Chornomorsk"
      - "Bar → Constanta"
    citations:
      - "Correction: Adriatic vessels often ballast to Black Sea due to lack of backhaul"
      
  east_med_to_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "East Mediterranean"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea (POC, Danube)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Coaster", "Small Handy"]
    score: 11
    confidence: 85
    reasoning: |
      Common backhaul pattern. After discharging in East Med ports
      (Egypt, Libya, Lebanon, Israel), many vessels return to Black Sea.
      Strong backhaul market exists.
    examples:
      - "Alexandria → Chornomorsk"
      - "Mersin → Constanta"
    citations:
      - "Correction: East Med vessels commonly return to Black Sea for backhaul"

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # DANUBE-SPECIFIC PATTERNS (Complex Economics)
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  danube_port_to_poc:
    vessel_opens: "Danube River ports (Braila, Reni, Izmail, Giurgiulesti)"
    vessel_opens_NOT: "Sulina Anchorage"
    cargo_loads: "POC (Chornomorsk, Pivdennyi, Odessa)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster"]
    score: 8
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      SECONDARY option. If vessel is already IN Danube port, it has
      paid high costs to enter (Sulina Bar transit fees, pilotage).
      Owners will PREFER to find cargo FROM Danube ports first to
      recoup these entry costs. Shifting to POC is possible but not ideal.
    key_principle: "Already paid Danube entry costs → seeks Danube cargo first"
    examples:
      - "Vessel at Braila → Chornomorsk loading"
      - "Vessel at Izmail → Chornomorsk loading"
    citations:
      - "Correction 1 (akdeniz): Danube vessels prefer Danube cargo to offset Sulina costs"
      
  sulina_anchorage_to_poc:
    vessel_opens: "Sulina Anchorage"
    cargo_loads: "POC (Chornomorsk, Pivdennyi, Odessa)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster"]
    score: 14
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      HIGH favorability. Sulina is a WAITING AREA / ANCHORAGE where
      vessels wait for either:
      a) Entry into Danube River, OR
      b) Direct call to POC ports
      
      From Sulina, POC and Danube are EQUAL choices - vessel has not
      yet committed to either direction. Distance to POC is minimal (~80nm).
    key_principle: "Sulina = neutral waiting area, POC and Danube equally viable"
    examples:
      - "Vessel at Sulina anchorage → Chornomorsk"
    citations:
      - "Correction 3 (eleanora): Sulina vessels can proceed to POC or Danube equally"
      
  heading_to_danube_to_poc:
    vessel_opens: "In transit, destination = Danube port"
    cargo_loads: "POC (Chornomorsk, Pivdennyi, Odessa)"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Coaster", "Coaster"]
    score: 7
    confidence: 85
    reasoning: |
      LOW favorability. If vessel is HEADING TO (destination set to)
      a Danube port, it indicates owners have already chosen to enter
      Danube. Redirecting to POC is possible but requires changing plans.
    key_principle: "Vessel already committed to Danube direction"
    examples:
      - "Vessel heading to Izmail → Chornomorsk loading"
    warning: |
      AI should also ask owner to clarify if vessel is really opening
      in Danube or if it's loading there and will open elsewhere.

  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # GEOPOLITICAL RESTRICTIONS
  # ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  russian_black_sea_to_ukraine:
    vessel_opens: "Russian Black Sea (Novorossiysk, Kavkaz, Kerch, Taman)"
    cargo_loads: "Ukraine (POC)"
    vessel_sizes: ["ALL"]
    score: 2
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      MINIMAL viability due to geopolitical situation (Russia-Ukraine war,
      sanctions). Vessels opening in Russian Black Sea ports will seek
      Russian cargoes. Extremely unlikely to position to Ukrainian ports.
    key_principle: "Geopolitical barriers prevent Russian → Ukraine trades"
    examples:
      - "Novorossiysk → Chornomorsk (highly unlikely)"
    citations:
      - "Correction: Russian Black Sea vessels will seek Russian cargo, not Ukraine"
      
  ukraine_to_russian_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "Ukraine (POC)"
    cargo_loads: "Russian Black Sea"
    vessel_sizes: ["ALL"]
    score: 2
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      Same geopolitical barriers apply in reverse direction.
      Sanctions and war situation prevent normal trade flows.

  west_med_to_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "West Mediterranean (Spain, France, Algeria, Morocco)"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea"
    vessel_sizes: ["Coaster", "Small Handy"]
    score: 8
    confidence: 75
    reasoning: |
      Longer ballast leg (~2000nm) but viable for right freight rates.
      More common for Small Handy size, less for pure coasters.
    examples:
      - "Barcelona → Chornomorsk"
      
  atlantic_to_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "Atlantic (Portugal, UK, Morocco Atlantic coast)"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea"
    vessel_sizes: ["Small Handy", "Handy"]
    score: 6
    confidence: 70
    reasoning: |
      Long ballast (~3000nm). Requires strong freight incentive.
      Only viable for larger vessels or exceptional market conditions.
      
  west_africa_to_black_sea:
    vessel_opens: "West Africa (Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria)"
    cargo_loads: "Black Sea"
    vessel_sizes: ["Coaster"]
    score: 0
    confidence: 90
    reasoning: |
      Commercially non-viable for coasters. Distance ~4200nm creates
      prohibitive ballast costs. Would only occur for larger vessels
      or very exceptional circumstances.
    examples:
      - "Dakar → Chornomorsk (not viable for 7k coaster)"
    citations:
      - "Correction 7 (ak beauty): West Africa ballast non-viable for coaster"

# VESSEL SIZE ADJUSTMENTS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

vessel_size_adjustments:

================================================================================
P2A — PSC PORT ACCESSIBILITY SCORING
Version: 4.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Evaluate whether the vessel can safely call at the cargo's loading and 
  discharge ports without excessive PSC (Port State Control) risk. Considers
  vessel's class, P&I, age, flag, and inspection history against port 
  strictness tiers.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 20]
ALWAYS ACTIVE: This criterion always has max_score = 20

================================================================================
PORT STRICTNESS TIERS
================================================================================

  TIER 1 — Very Strict (high detention risk)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Countries: Italy, France, Greece, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Netherlands,
               Germany, UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland,
               Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, South Korea
    
  TIER 2 — Moderate Strict
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Countries: Turkey, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Albania, 
               Romania, Bulgaria, Egypt (Suez/Alex)
               
  TIER 3 — Moderate Tolerant
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Countries: Ukraine, Russia (Black Sea ports), Georgia, 
               Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Libya, Lebanon, Syria
               
  TIER 4 — Lax (low detention risk)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Countries: Most West Africa, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan,
               most Southeast Asia, Central America, South America

================================================================================
VESSEL STATUS CATEGORIES
================================================================================

  HIGH STATUS — Score bonus for strict ports
    Class: IACS member (BV, LR, DNV, ABS, ClassNK, RINA, CCS, KR, RS, PRS, CRS, IRS)
    P&I: Top-tier IG club (Gard, Skuld, UK P&I, West of England, etc.)
    Flag: White list (Paris MOU) — EU flags, Marshall Islands, Bahamas,
          Panama, Liberia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, Norway
    Age: < 15 years
    
    Note: Vessel qualifies as HIGH if it meets MOST criteria (3 out of 4).
    
  MEDIUM STATUS — Standard scoring
    Class: IACS or recognized non-IACS (Turkish Lloyd, Indian Register, etc.)
    P&I: Some P&I coverage (not necessarily IG)
    Flag: Grey list or non-blacklisted flag
    Age: 15-25 years
    
    Note: Default category. Most Black Sea/Med coasters fall here.
    
  LOW STATUS — Penalty for strict ports
    Class: Non-IACS / unknown / expired
    P&I: No P&I or unknown
    Flag: Black list (Paris MOU) or flag of convenience with poor record
    Age: > 25 years
    
    Note: Any ONE critical deficiency (no class, no P&I, blacklisted flag)
    can push vessel to LOW status.

  FLAG LISTS (Paris MOU — simplified):
    White list (good): Most EU flags, Marshall Islands, Bahamas, Singapore,
      Hong Kong, Japan, Norway, Panama (generally), Liberia
    Grey list (watch): Some flags with moderate detention rates
    Black list (bad): Flags with consistently high detention rates
    
    Note: Paris MOU flag lists are updated annually. When in doubt,
    treat unknown flags as Grey list.

================================================================================
BASE SCORING MATRIX
================================================================================

  Port Tier 1 (Very Strict):
    HIGH status:   16-20/20
    MEDIUM status: 10-14/20
    LOW status:    2-6/20 (potential BLOCK if critical deficiency)

  Port Tier 2 (Moderate Strict):
    HIGH status:   18-20/20
    MEDIUM status: 14-17/20
    LOW status:    6-10/20

  Port Tier 3 (Moderate Tolerant):
    HIGH status:   20/20
    MEDIUM status: 16-19/20
    LOW status:    10-14/20

  Port Tier 4 (Lax):
    HIGH status:   20/20
    MEDIUM status: 18-20/20
    LOW status:    14-18/20

================================================================================
PORT HISTORY BONUS
================================================================================

  If the vessel has RECENT successful calls at ports in the SAME TIER or 
  HIGHER (stricter) tier as the cargo ports, apply a bonus.
  
  RULES:
    - Bonus applies to SAME tier AND lower (less strict) tiers
    - Bonuses do NOT stack — use highest applicable only
    - "Recent" = within last 12 months of port history
    - We do NOT have detention data — do not require "no detention"

  BONUS VALUES:
  
    Tier 1 history: +3 for ALL tiers (1, 2, 3, 4)
    Tier 2 history: +2 for Tier 2, 3, 4 only (NOT Tier 1)
    Tier 3 history: +1 for Tier 3, 4 only
    Tier 4 history: No bonus

  EXAMPLES:
    Vessel called Ravenna (Italy, Tier 1) → +3 for everything
    Vessel called Istanbul (Turkey, Tier 2) → +2 for Tier 2/3/4, NOT Tier 1
    Vessel called BOTH Naples AND Samsun → use Naples (+3), don't stack

  BONUS CAP: Total P2A score cannot exceed 20

================================================================================
SCORING FOR MULTIPLE PORTS
================================================================================

  When cargo has both loading and discharge ports:
    - Score each port separately (status + tier + bonus)
    - Final P2A = weighted average (load port 60%, discharge port 40%)
    - If either port results in BLOCK → entire P2A is BLOCK
    
  Show both port scores in reasoning for transparency.

================================================================================
BLOCK CONDITIONS
================================================================================

  - LOW status vessel + Tier 1 port + no port history bonus → BLOCK
  - Vessel on Paris MOU blacklist + any EU port → BLOCK
  - No class certificate + Tier 1 or 2 port → BLOCK

================================================================================
OFFER HINTS
================================================================================

  High score (16+): null
  Medium score (10-15): "PSC risk manageable — vessel [class/age/flag] may 
    draw attention at [port]."
  Low score (<10): "Significant PSC risk at [port]."
  BLOCK: "Cannot safely call at [port] — do not offer."

================================================================================
AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Determine vessel status (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on class, P&I, flag, age
    - Look up port tiers for ALL cargo ports
    - Check vessel port history for bonus eligibility
    - Apply highest applicable bonus (no stacking)
    - Score using the matrix
    - Show BOTH port scores when cargo has 2 ports
    
  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never require "no detention" data (we don't have it)
    - ❌ Never stack multiple port history bonuses
    - ❌ Never apply Tier 2 bonus to Tier 1 ports
    - ❌ Never block solely based on age
    - ❌ Never confuse P2A with P8 (P2A = PSC risk, P8 = cargo restrictions)

================================================================================
P4 — LAST PORTS / PORT HISTORY SCORING
Version: 2.0 FINAL
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Score vessel's familiarity with the cargo's loading and discharge regions
  based on port call history. Vessels that regularly call at or near the
  cargo ports are more likely to be interested and operationally prepared.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 10]
ALWAYS ACTIVE: max_score = 10

================================================================================
DATA SOURCES — USE BOTH
================================================================================

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  AI must check BOTH vessel-level AND company-level port data.  ║
  ║  Use the BETTER score from either source (not average).        ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  SOURCE 1: top_ports.vessel (array)
    Specific vessel's port call history.
    Format: [{"label": "Istanbul", "percent": 13.1, "visits": 8}, ...]
    Weight: PRIMARY — vessel's own track record.
    
  SOURCE 2: top_ports.company.items (array)
    All vessels of the same company/operator.
    Format: [{"label": "Constanta", "percent": 3.0, "visits": 21}, ...]
    Weight: SECONDARY — shows company's trade pattern.
    Company data demonstrates the operator knows the area even if
    this specific vessel hasn't been there recently.

  COMBINED LOGIC:
    - Check both sources against each cargo port
    - For each port, use the HIGHER match level from either source
    - If vessel has exact match → use that (vessel-level is stronger)
    - If only company has exact match → use company level but reduce
      by 1 point (company = familiar, not this specific vessel)

  SOURCE 3: recent-ports-call (if available)
    Specific recent port calls with dates. May be null.
    If available, can supplement top_ports data.

================================================================================
SCORING LOGIC
================================================================================

  Check vessel's port history against BOTH loading port AND discharge port.
  
  LEVEL 1 — EXACT PORT MATCH (8-10/10)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Vessel or company has called at the exact loading or discharge port.
    
    Vessel-level:
      High frequency (>5%): 10/10
      Medium frequency (2-5%): 9/10
      Low frequency (<2%): 8/10
      
    Company-level only (vessel hasn't called, but company fleet has):
      High frequency (>3%): 9/10
      Medium frequency (1-3%): 8/10
      Low frequency (<1%): 7/10

  LEVEL 2 — SAME SUB-REGION (5-7/10)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    History in the same sub-region or country.
    
    Sub-region groups:
      POC group: Odessa, Chornomorsk, Pivdennyi, Mykolaiv
      Danube group: Izmail, Reni, Braila, Galati
      CVB group: Constanta, Varna, Burgas
      Turkish BS: Samsun, Trabzon, Zonguldak, Eregli, Novorossiysk*
      Turkish Med: Mersin, Iskenderun, Antalya, Toros Gubre Terminal
      Marmara: Istanbul, Derince, Gemlik, Yarimca, Diliskelesi, Tuzla
      East Med: Alexandria, Damietta, Beirut, Haifa, Ashdod, Limassol
      North Africa: Tunis, Bizerte, Sfax, Sousse, Mostaganem, 
                    Algiers, Oran, Tripoli (Libya)
      Adriatic: Ravenna, Venice, Trieste, Rijeka, Bar, Durres
      Aegean: Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Izmir, Aliaga, Nemrut Bay
      West Med: Barcelona, Valencia, Marseille, Genoa
      Baltic: Gdansk, Ust-Luga, Klaipeda, Riga
      Atlantic: Pasajes, Lisboa, Bilbao, Montoir
      
    * Novorossiysk is Russian BS, adjacent to Turkish BS. Count as
      "same broad region" as Ukrainian BS (POC), not same sub-region.
    
    High frequency in sub-region (>10% combined): 7/10
    Medium frequency (5-10% combined): 6/10
    Low frequency (<5% combined): 5/10

  LEVEL 3 — SAME BROAD REGION (3-4/10)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    History in the broader region but not the specific sub-region.
    
    Broad regions:
      Black Sea: POC + CVB + Turkish BS + Novorossiysk
      Mediterranean: Turkish Med + Marmara + East Med + North Africa +
                     Adriatic + Aegean + West Med
      Atlantic/Continent: UK, NW Europe, Iberian, Baltic
      
    Regular broad region caller (>5% combined): 4/10
    Occasional broad region caller (<5%): 3/10

  LEVEL 4 — NO RELEVANT HISTORY (5/10 — neutral)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    No port history in the cargo's regions. NEUTRAL — not negative.
    score = 5/10

  LEVEL 5 — CONFLICTING PATTERN (1-2/10)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    100% of history in completely different region with no overlap.
    score = 1-2/10

================================================================================
SCORING FOR BOTH PORTS
================================================================================

  Cargo with loading + discharge ports in different regions:
    - Score each port area separately
    - Weighted average: loading port 60%, discharge port 40%
    - Round to nearest 0.5

================================================================================
EXAMPLES
================================================================================

  Example 1: PETREL S for POC → Tunisia
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Vessel top_ports: Istanbul 13.1%, Mostaganem 6.6%, Haifa 4.9%,
      Novorossiysk 3.3%
    Company top_ports: Istanbul 10.9%, Constanta 3%, Novorossiysk 3.1%
    Cargo: loads POC (Chornomorsk), discharges Tunisia
    
    LOADING (POC/Chornomorsk):
      Vessel: No exact POC match. Novorossiysk 3.3% = Russian BS
        → broad region match (BS) = 4/10
      Company: Constanta 3% = CVB group, adjacent to POC
        → sub-region match (neighboring BS) = 5/10
      USE BETTER: 5/10 (company Constanta)
      
    DISCHARGE (Tunisia):
      Vessel: Mostaganem 6.6% = North Africa sub-region = 6/10
      Company: no direct North Africa match. But Ravenna 2.7% = 
        Med (broad region) = 3/10
      USE BETTER: 6/10 (vessel Mostaganem)
      
    P4 = (5 × 0.6) + (6 × 0.4) = 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4 → 5.5/10

  Example 2: Strong match (exact ports)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Vessel: Haifa 45.6%, Ashdod 15.8%, Mersin 12%
    Cargo: loads Chornomorsk, discharges Haifa
    
    Loading: No BS history → 5/10 (neutral)
    Discharge: Haifa exact 45.6% → 10/10
    P4 = (5 × 0.6) + (10 × 0.4) = 7.0/10

  Example 3: No data
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    top_ports = null or empty
    P4 = 5/10 (neutral), confidence = "low"

================================================================================
AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Check BOTH top_ports.vessel AND top_ports.company.items
    - Use the BETTER match level from either source
    - Score each cargo port (load + discharge) separately
    - Apply weighted average (60% load, 40% discharge)
    - Give neutral 5/10 when no relevant history (not 0)
    - List cited ports with percentages in reasoning
    
  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never use only vessel-level OR only company-level — check BOTH
    - ❌ Never give 0/10 just because exact port not in history
    - ❌ Never ignore company top_ports when vessel data is sparse
    - ❌ Never treat "no data" as negative — it's neutral (5/10)
    - ❌ Never confuse P4 (port history) with P2 (owner preferences)

================================================================================
P8 — RESTRICTIONS COMPLIANCE SCORING
Version: 2.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Score how well the vessel complies with charterer/cargo restrictions.
  Restrictions come from the cargo/inquiry settings and define specific
  requirements the vessel must meet. Supports both hard (pass/fail) and
  gradual (scale) restrictions with per-restriction allocation.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 20]
DYNAMIC CRITERION: If no restrictions set → score = 0, max_score = 0 (excluded)

================================================================================
CRITICAL — WHAT P8 DOES AND DOES NOT COVER
================================================================================

  P8 COVERS ONLY these restriction types from cargo/inquiry settings:
    HARD: Class, P&I Club, IMO Class, Holds Type
    GRADUAL: DWT, Age, LOA, Beam

  P8 DOES NOT COVER — DO NOT SCORE THESE IN P8:
    ❌ Draft / draught restrictions → handled in P5 (Intake Calculator)
    ❌ Port physical limitations → handled in P5 via port_restrictions_map
    ❌ Vessel proximity / distance → handled in P1
    ❌ PSC / flag / inspection risk → handled in P2A
    ❌ Cargo type compatibility → handled in P3
    ❌ Owner regional preferences → handled in P2

  If cargo description mentions "draft 7.5m limit" — this is a P5 matter.
  AI must NOT create a draft restriction in P8.

================================================================================
NO RESTRICTIONS → EXCLUDED
================================================================================

  If the cargo/inquiry has NO restrictions from the 8 types above:
    score = 0
    max_score = 0
    reasoning = "No restrictions set — criterion excluded from scoring."
    offer_hint = null

================================================================================
RESTRICTION TYPES
================================================================================

  HARD RESTRICTIONS (pass/fail — no gradient):
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  
    CLASS — Required classification society
      Pass: Vessel class matches required (e.g., IACS when IACS required)
      Fail: Vessel class doesn't match
      BLOCK: When class is explicitly required (e.g., "BV/LR/DNV only")
      
    P&I CLUB — Required P&I coverage
      Pass: Vessel has required P&I club or tier
      Fail: Vessel doesn't have required P&I
      BLOCK: When specific IG club is mandatory
      
    IMO CLASS — Required for dangerous goods
      Pass: Vessel has required IMO fitness (e.g., class 1.1, class 9)
      Fail: Vessel not certified for required IMO class
      BLOCK: Always when dangerous cargo requires specific IMO certification
      
    HOLDS TYPE — Box-shaped vs non-box
      Pass: Vessel hold type matches requirement
      Fail: Hold type doesn't match
      Note: Usually not a BLOCK, sometimes negotiable

  GRADUAL RESTRICTIONS (scale — degrees of compliance):
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
  
    DWT — Maximum deadweight tonnage
      Within limit: 100% of allocated points
      Within 5% over: 75% of allocated points
      Within 10% over: 50% of allocated points
      Over 10%: 0% of allocated points
      BLOCK: Over 15% of limit (vessel too big for berth/facility)
      
    AGE — Maximum vessel age
      ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
      ║  CRITICAL: AGE NEVER TRIGGERS BLOCK. NEVER. NO EXCEPTIONS. ║
      ║  Age is ALWAYS negotiable with charterer. Even +10 years    ║
      ║  over limit = 0 points but vessel is still scoreable.      ║
      ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
      Within limit: 100% of allocated points
      +1-2 years over: 75% of allocated points
      +3-5 years over: 50% of allocated points
      +5 years over: 0% of allocated points
      BLOCK: NEVER — age is always negotiable
      
    LOA — Maximum length overall
      Within limit: 100% of allocated points
      Within 5% over: 75% of allocated points
      Over 5%: 0% of allocated points
      BLOCK: LOA is usually physical limitation (berth length)
      
    BEAM — Maximum beam
      Within limit: 100% of allocated points
      Within 5% over: 75% of allocated points
      Over 5%: 0% of allocated points
      Note: Less commonly restricted

================================================================================
SCORING FORMULA
================================================================================

  1. Count active restrictions (ONLY from the 8 types listed above)
     Do NOT invent additional restriction types.
  
  2. Allocate points equally:
     points_per_restriction = 20 / number_of_active_restrictions
     
  3. Score each restriction:
  
     HARD restriction:
       Pass → full allocated points
       Fail → 0 points (+ potential BLOCK if critical)
       
     GRADUAL restriction:
       Full pass (within limit) → 100% of allocated points
       Close (within 5% for DWT/LOA/Beam, +1-2yr for Age) → 75%
       Marginal (within 10% for DWT, +3-5yr for Age) → 50%
       Fail (beyond thresholds) → 0%
       
  4. Sum all restriction scores
  
  5. Check for BLOCK conditions (NEVER for age)

================================================================================
BLOCK CONDITIONS
================================================================================

  FULL VESSEL BLOCK (do not offer):
    - Hard fail on Class when charterer EXPLICITLY requires specific class
    - Hard fail on IMO when cargo is classified dangerous goods
    - DWT exceeds limit by more than 15%
    - LOA exceeds limit by more than 5% (physical berth limitation)

  NEVER BLOCK (scored 0 but vessel remains scoreable):
    - Age over limit — ALWAYS negotiable, no matter how much over
    - Holds type mismatch — often negotiable
    - DWT within 15% over — negotiable with charterer
    - P&I not matching preference — usually negotiable
    - Beam over limit — usually negotiable

================================================================================
EXAMPLES
================================================================================

  EXAMPLE 1: Three restrictions, all pass
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Restrictions: DWT max 12000, Age max 20 years, Class IACS
    3 restrictions → 20/3 = 6.67 pts each
    
    Vessel: DWT 11,500 (pass), Age 18 (pass), Class BV (IACS, pass)
    Score: 6.67 + 6.67 + 6.67 = 20/20
    offer_hint: null (all restrictions met)

  EXAMPLE 2: Age +2 years over — NOT a block
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Restrictions: Age max 25 years, DWT max 18000
    2 restrictions → 10 pts each
    
    Vessel: Age 27 (+2yr over), DWT 16,000 (pass)
    Age: 10 × 0.75 = 7.5 (gradual, +1-2yr = 75%)
    DWT: 10 × 1.0 = 10.0 (within limit)
    Score: 7.5 + 10.0 = 17.5/20
    Decision: "accepted" — NOT blocked
    offer_hint: "Vessel is 2 years over age limit — negotiable. 
                 Emphasize vessel condition and recent survey dates."

  EXAMPLE 3: Age +7 years over — STILL not a block
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Restrictions: Age max 20 years
    1 restriction → 20 pts
    
    Vessel: Age 27 (+7yr over)
    Age: 20 × 0.0 = 0 (beyond +5yr)
    Score: 0/20
    Decision: "accepted" with very low score — NOT blocked
    offer_hint: "Vessel significantly over age limit. Offer only if 
                 market is tight and condition is excellent."

  EXAMPLE 4: Mixed results
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Restrictions: DWT max 12000, Age max 20, Class IACS
    3 restrictions → 6.67 pts each
    
    Vessel: DWT 12,400 (5% over), Age 22 (+2yr), Class non-IACS (fail)
    DWT: 6.67 × 0.75 = 5.0
    Age: 6.67 × 0.75 = 5.0
    Class: 0 (fail)
    Score: 10/20
    offer_hint: "Non-IACS class — expect pushback. DWT and age close 
                 to limits but acceptable."

  EXAMPLE 5: IMO BLOCK
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Restrictions: IMO class 9 required, DWT max 15000
    2 restrictions → 10 pts each
    
    Vessel: No IMO cert (fail → BLOCK), DWT 14,500 (pass)
    Score: BLOCK
    offer_hint: "Vessel not certified for IMO cargo — do not offer."

  EXAMPLE 6: Cargo has draft restriction — NOT scored in P8
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Cargo description: "Age max 25 years, draft 7.5m limit"
    
    P8 restrictions: Age max 25 years ONLY (1 restriction → 20 pts)
    Draft 7.5m → goes to P5 (Intake Calculator), NOT P8
    
    Vessel: Age 27 (+2yr over)
    Age: 20 × 0.75 = 15

AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Check ONLY the 8 restriction types listed in this file
    - Score each restriction individually with percentage

  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ NEVER BLOCK vessel for age — age is ALWAYS negotiable
    - ❌ NEVER BLOCK vessel for age even combined with other fails
    - ❌ NEVER score draft/draught in P8 — draft belongs in P5
    - ❌ NEVER invent restriction types beyond the 8 listed
    - ❌ NEVER assume "IACS required" unless explicitly stated
    - ❌ NEVER apply P8 when no restrictions exist (use 0/0)
    - ❌ NEVER count draft as a "restriction" in P8

================================================================================
READINESS / ETA TO LOADING PORT SCORING — P7
Version: 5.0 FINAL
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Score how well the vessel's availability timing matches the cargo laycan.
  Integrates draught analysis to determine if vessel needs operations buffer.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 10]
ALWAYS ACTIVE: max_score = 10

================================================================================
STEP 1 — MANDATORY DRAUGHT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  AI MUST perform draught analysis BEFORE calculating            ║
  ║  vessel_ready date. See vessel_location_determination.txt       ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  FIELD USAGE:
    current_draught = field "current-draught" (from AIS)
    max_draft = field "draft" (summer loadline from vessel specs)
    ❌ Do NOT use "max-draught" field (max recorded, includes tropical)
    ❌ Do NOT use "min-draught" field (ballast reference only)

  DRAUGHT RATIO:
    ratio = current_draught / max_draft (using field "draft")
    
    ratio < 0.65  → BALLAST
    ratio >= 0.65 → LADEN
    current > max → OVER_DRAFT → treat as LADEN

================================================================================
STEP 2 — DETERMINE VESSEL READY DATE
================================================================================

  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  CASE A: Vessel has open_area with date                 │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    Example: open_area = "Montoir, Feb 17"
    vessel_ready = Feb 17
    No buffer needed — vessel stated as open.
    Then calculate sailing time from open location to load port.
    vessel_at_loadport = vessel_ready + sailing_days
    
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  CASE B: Vessel underway with destination + future ETA  │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    ETA is in the FUTURE (after today).
    
    BALLAST → vessel arrives at ETA. Available immediately.
      vessel_ready = ETA
      Then + sailing from destination to load port (if different)
      
    LADEN → vessel arrives, needs to discharge.
      vessel_ready = ETA + 7 days (operations buffer)
      Then + sailing from destination to load port (if different)
      
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  CASE C: Vessel at destination / ETA in the PAST        │
  │  (IMPORTANT — common real-world scenario)               │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    Triggered when ANY of:
      - navigation-status = "At anchor" or "Moored"
      - ETA is in the past (before today)
      - Vessel speed < 2 knots AND at destination area
      
    The vessel has ALREADY ARRIVED at its destination.
    
    BALLAST at destination:
      Vessel is empty, waiting for cargo/orders.
      vessel_ready = TODAY (available now)
      Then + sailing from current location to load port
      
    LADEN at destination:
      Vessel is waiting to discharge or currently discharging.
      
      FORMULA:
        days_since_arrival = TODAY - MAX(ETA, position_received - 3 days)
        remaining_ops = MAX(0, 7 - days_since_arrival)
        vessel_ready = TODAY + remaining_ops
        
      Logic: Standard discharge takes ~7 days. If vessel arrived 
      6 days ago, only ~1 day remaining. If arrived today, 7 days.
      
      MINIMUM: vessel_ready = TODAY (never in the past)
      
      Then + sailing from current location to load port

    EXAMPLE (PETREL S):
      ETA = Feb 1, today = Feb 7, nav = "At anchor", laden (ratio 0.97)
      days_since_arrival = Feb 7 - Feb 1 = 6 days
      remaining_ops = MAX(0, 7 - 6) = 1 day
      vessel_ready = Feb 7 + 1 = Feb 8
      sailing Lisboa → POC: ~3000nm / 10.2 knots / 24 = ~12.3 days
      vessel_at_loadport = Feb 8 + 12 = Feb 20
      
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  CASE D: No destination / no ETA                        │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
    Estimate sailing time from current position to load port.
    Use average-speed or default 10-12 knots.
    Add 1 day buffer.
    confidence = "low"

================================================================================
STEP 3 — CALCULATE SAILING TIME TO LOAD PORT
================================================================================

  After determining vessel_ready, calculate sailing to load port:
  
  sailing_days = distance_nm / (speed_knots × 24)
  
  Speed source (priority):
    1. field "average-speed" (if available and > 0)
    2. Default 10.5 knots for bulk carriers / general cargo
    
  vessel_at_loadport = vessel_ready + sailing_days
  
  Note: If vessel is ALREADY near load port area, sailing_days ≈ 0.

================================================================================
STEP 4 — CALCULATE GAP
================================================================================

  gap = vessel_at_loadport - cargo_layday (start of laycan)
  
  Positive gap = vessel is late (arrives AFTER layday)
  Negative gap = vessel is early (arrives BEFORE layday)
  Zero = perfect timing

================================================================================
STEP 5 — SCORING MATRIX
================================================================================

  gap <= -7 days (very early):     score = 4/10
  gap = -6 to -3 days (early):    score = 7/10
  gap = -2 to +1 days (ideal):    score = 10/10
  gap = +2 to +3 days (slightly late): score = 7/10
  gap = +4 to +5 days (late):     score = 4/10
  gap = +6 to +7 days (very late): score = 2/10
  gap > +7 days (past canceling):  score = 0/10, decision = BLOCK

================================================================================
EXAMPLES
================================================================================

  Example 1: Laden at anchor, ETA in past (PETREL S scenario)
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Vessel: At anchor Lisboa. ETA Feb 1 (past). Today Feb 7.
    current-draught: 8.3, draft: 8.48 → ratio 0.978 → LADEN
    days_since_arrival = 6. remaining_ops = MAX(0, 7-6) = 1
    vessel_ready = Feb 8
    Sailing Lisboa → POC: 3000nm / 10.2kn / 24h = 12.3d ≈ 12d
    vessel_at_loadport = Feb 8 + 12 = Feb 20
    Cargo layday Feb 5, canceling Feb 10
    gap = Feb 20 - Feb 5 = +15 days → BLOCK
    reasoning: "Laden at anchor Lisboa since ~Feb 1 (ratio 0.978).
               Est. ready Feb 8, +12d sailing = arrives POC ~Feb 20.
               Misses canceling Feb 10 by 10 days."

  Example 2: Ballast underway, future ETA
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Vessel heading Mersin, ETA Feb 10. ratio 0.40 → BALLAST
    vessel_ready = Feb 10 (no buffer)
    Cargo loads Mersin → sailing = 0 days
    vessel_at_loadport = Feb 10
    Layday Feb 8 → gap = +2 days → score = 7/10

  Example 3: Open vessel
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    open_area = "Constanta, Feb 12"
    vessel_ready = Feb 12
    Cargo loads Chornomorsk (~50nm) → 0.2d sailing
    vessel_at_loadport = Feb 12
    Layday Feb 14 → gap = -2 days → score = 10/10

  Example 4: Laden underway, future ETA
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Heading Ravenna, ETA Feb 13. ratio 0.85 → LADEN
    vessel_ready = Feb 13 + 7 = Feb 20
    Sailing Ravenna → POC: ~800nm / 10.5kn = 3.2d ≈ 3d
    vessel_at_loadport = Feb 20 + 3 = Feb 23
    Layday Feb 5 → gap = +18 → BLOCK

  Example 5: No draught data
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Heading Istanbul, ETA Feb 8. No current-draught.
    Default LADEN. vessel_ready = Feb 8 + 7 = Feb 15
    confidence = "medium"

================================================================================
REASONING FORMAT
================================================================================

  P7 reasoning MUST include:
    1. Draught analysis: ratio, ballast/laden status
    2. How vessel_ready was calculated (which CASE)
    3. Sailing time to load port (distance, speed, days)
    4. vessel_at_loadport date
    5. Gap in days
    6. Laycan reference (layday + canceling dates)

  Good: "Laden at anchor Lisboa since ~Feb 1 (ratio 0.978). 
         Remaining ops ~1d, ready Feb 8. +12d sailing to POC = 
         arrives ~Feb 20. Layday Feb 5, canceling Feb 10, gap +15d."
         
  Bad:  "Vessel is laden in Lisboa. Ready Feb 11 + 11d sailing = Feb 22."
        (Where does Feb 11 come from? Unclear.)

================================================================================
AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - ALWAYS perform draught analysis first (use "draft" field, not "max-draught")
    - Determine which CASE applies (A/B/C/D)
    - For CASE C (at anchor/ETA past): calculate days_since_arrival
    - Calculate sailing time from ready location to LOAD PORT
    - Show all calculation steps in reasoning
    - Use field "average-speed" when available for sailing calculation
    
  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never use "max-draught" for draught ratio
    - ❌ Never skip draught analysis
    - ❌ Never forget to add sailing time to load port
    - ❌ Never produce vessel_ready date without showing how it was derived
    - ❌ Never ignore "At anchor" / "Moored" navigation status
    - ❌ Never ignore ETA being in the past

# Estimation Template — JSON Output Format
## Version 5.0 — Updated 2026-02-07

This file defines the expected JSON output format for vessel scoring results.
AI should produce output matching this structure.

---

## Critical Rules

1. **total_score is ALWAYS a percentage** (0-100), never raw points
2. **ALL criteria must appear** in detailed_scoring, even excluded ones (0/0)
3. **Draft restrictions go to P5**, never to P8
4. **Age NEVER triggers BLOCK** in P8

    }
  }
}
```

Note: In this example, P5 is BLOCKED due to draft restriction (7.5m limit makes
loading impossible), but P8 only handles age (not draft). Age is NOT blocked.

## Key Reminders

- `total_score` = percentage (0-100), NEVER raw points
- `total_score_raw` = sum of actual points (informational)
- `dynamic_max_score` = sum of max_score for active criteria only
- ALL 9 criteria appear in detailed_scoring (excluded show 0/0)
- Draft restrictions → P5, never P8
- Age in P8 → NEVER triggers BLOCK
- `offer_opening` not generated when BLOCKED
- `restrictions_checked` array only in P8
- `relationship_warning` is separate from detailed_scoring

================================================================================
INTAKE CALCULATOR FORMULA — P5
Version: 5.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Calculate vessel's cargo intake capacity and score how well the vessel 
  fits the cargo quantity requirements. Multi-step process covering weight,
  volume, draft restrictions, vessel utilization, and cubature.

  P5 is the ONLY criterion that handles draft/draught restrictions.
  Draft restrictions are NEVER scored in P8. If cargo mentions "draft 7.5m
  limit", that restriction is processed here in P5.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 15]
ALWAYS ACTIVE: max_score = 15
MINIMUM SCORE: 2 (except when BLOCK)

================================================================================
STEP 1 — PARSE CARGO QUANTITY (min_qty / max_qty)
================================================================================

  Convert cargo quantity description into numeric min/max range:
  
  "15,000t +/-10%"     → min 13,500 / max 16,500
  "6000/6600t"         → min 6,000 / max 6,600
  "6000t MOLOO"        → min 5,700 / max 6,300 (±5%)
  "6000t" (no qualifier) → min 5,700 / max 6,300 (assume ±5%)
  "15,000mt 10% MOLOO" → min 13,500 / max 16,500
  "abt 8,000t"         → min 7,600 / max 8,400 (±5%)

================================================================================
STEP 2 — CALCULATE VESSEL INTAKE
================================================================================

  A) WEIGHT INTAKE:
     weight_intake = DWT - ROB
     ROB (Remaining On Board) = 250 tonnes (default fuel/water/stores)
     
     If DWT is not available → BLOCK with note "Missing DWT data"
     
  B) VOLUME INTAKE (if stowage factor and grain capacity known):
     volume_intake = grain_capacity / SF
     
     grain_capacity = from vessel specs (cubic feet)
     SF = Stowage Factor of the cargo (cubic feet per tonne)
     
     Common SF values:
       Wheat: 46-48 cbft/t       Corn/Maize: 47-50 cbft/t
       Barley: 49-53 cbft/t      Soybeans: 48-50 cbft/t
       Cement: 28-30 cbft/t      Coal: 42-48 cbft/t
       Fertilizer (urea): 42-45  Sugar: 38-42 cbft/t
       Steel products: 15-25     Rice: 42-52 cbft/t
       
     If grain_capacity or SF not available → skip volume check
     
  C) DRAFT-RESTRICTED INTAKE (when port or cargo has draft restriction):
  
     DRAFT RESTRICTION SOURCES (use the MORE restrictive value):
       1. port_restrictions_map.txt — physical port depth limit
       2. Cargo description — charterer-imposed draft limit
       
     If BOTH sources exist, use: MIN(port_limit, cargo_limit)
     If neither exists → no draft restriction applies
     
     FORMULA (simplified linear approximation):
       draft_ratio = port_max_draft / vessel_max_draft
       draft_restricted_intake = weight_intake × draft_ratio
       
     Note: This is a LINEAR approximation. Actual DWT/draft relationship
     is non-linear (depends on vessel hull design). For screening purposes
     this approximation is acceptable. Actual intake must be confirmed
     with the owner.
       
     If no draft restriction → draft_restricted_intake = unlimited
     
  D) FINAL INTAKE:
     final_intake = MIN(weight_intake, volume_intake, draft_restricted_intake)
     
     Record which factor is limiting: weight / volume / draft

================================================================================
STEP 3 — CARGO FIT SCORE (base P5 score)
================================================================================

  Compare final_intake to cargo min_qty / max_qty:
  
  PERFECT FIT: min_qty <= final_intake <= max_qty
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    P5_base = 15/15
    offer_hint: "Cargo fits vessel perfectly."
    
  UNDER CARGO: final_intake < min_qty
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    shortfall = 1 - (final_intake / min_qty)
    penalty = shortfall × 2.0
    P5_base = MAX(15 × (1 - penalty), 2)
    
    BLOCK CONDITION: final_intake < min_qty × 0.85
      → Vessel physically cannot load minimum required cargo
      → P5 = BLOCK
      
    offer_hint: "Intake below cargo minimum — be transparent about qty."
    
  OVER CARGO: final_intake > max_qty
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    excess = 1 - (max_qty / final_intake)
    penalty = excess × 2.0
    P5_base = MAX(15 × (1 - penalty), 2)
    
    Note: No BLOCK for over-cargo — vessel can always load less.
    But penalized because owner won't want to waste capacity.
    
    offer_hint: "Vessel larger than needed — emphasize attractive rate."

================================================================================
STEP 4 — VESSEL UTILIZATION PENALTY (additional modifier)
================================================================================

  PURPOSE: Penalize when external restrictions prevent vessel from using
  full capacity. Owner is less interested if vessel can only load 70%.
  
  APPLIES WHEN: Draft restriction or grain capacity limits reduce intake.
  
  FORMULA:
    unrestricted_intake = MIN(weight_intake, volume_intake)
    restricted_intake = MIN(weight_intake, volume_intake, draft_restricted_intake)
    
    restriction_ratio = restricted_intake / unrestricted_intake
    
    If restriction_ratio >= 0.85: no additional penalty
    
    If restriction_ratio < 0.85:
      vessel_util_penalty = (0.85 - restriction_ratio) × 1.5
      P5_score = P5_base × (1 - vessel_util_penalty)

================================================================================
STEP 5 — CUBATURE MODIFIER (for voluminous cargoes)
================================================================================

  APPLIES WHEN: SF > 47 (cargo is voluminous)
  
  FORMULA:
    cubature_ratio = volume_intake / weight_intake
    
    If cubature_ratio >= 0.85: no penalty
    
    If cubature_ratio < 0.85:
      cubature_penalty = (0.85 - cubature_ratio) × 1.5
      P5_score = P5_score × (1 - cubature_penalty)

================================================================================
FINAL P5 SCORE
================================================================================

  P5 = MAX(P5_score after all modifiers, 2)
  Unless BLOCK → then P5 = BLOCK
  
  BLOCK CONDITIONS:
    - final_intake < min_qty × 0.85 (vessel physically too small)
    - Missing DWT data
    
  Note: Draft restriction causing BLOCK in P5 means the vessel cannot
  physically load the cargo at the restricted draft. This is a P5 BLOCK,
  not a P8 BLOCK. P8 does NOT handle draft restrictions.

================================================================================
COMPLETE EXAMPLE — ADAMAR + WHEAT
================================================================================

  Cargo: wheat 15,000t +/-10% ex Chornomorsk, SF = 47, port draft 7.5m
  Vessel: ADAMAR, DWT 16,653, draft 8.6m, grain capacity 694,700 cbft
  
  Step 1: min_qty = 13,500, max_qty = 16,500
  
  Step 2:
    weight_intake = 16653 - 250 = 16,403
    volume_intake = 694700 / 47 = 14,781
    draft_restricted = 16403 × (7.5/8.6) = 14,305
    final_intake = MIN(16403, 14781, 14305) = 14,305 (draft-limited)
    
  Step 3: 13,500 <= 14,305 <= 16,500 → PERFECT FIT, P5_base = 15
    
  Step 4: unrestricted = 14,781 / restricted = 14,305
    ratio = 0.968 → no penalty
    
  Step 5: SF = 47, not > 47 → skipped
    
  Final P5 = 15/15

================================================================================
COMPLETE EXAMPLE — SMALL VESSEL + DRAFT RESTRICTION
================================================================================

  Cargo: wheat 8,000t +/-5%, SF = 47, port draft 6.0m
  Vessel: DWT 6,800, draft 7.2m, grain capacity 220,000 cbft
  
  Step 1: min_qty = 7,600, max_qty = 8,400
  
  Step 2:
    weight_intake = 6800 - 250 = 6,550
    volume_intake = 220000 / 47 = 4,681
    draft_restricted = 6550 × (6.0/7.2) = 5,458
    final_intake = MIN(6550, 4681, 5458) = 4,681 (volume-limited)
    
  Step 3: 4,681 < 7,600 × 0.85 = 6,460 → BLOCK
  
  Final P5 = BLOCK
  Note: This BLOCK is from P5, not P8. Draft is a P5 matter.

================================================================================
EDGE CASES
================================================================================

  Missing grain capacity:
    Skip volume_intake. Use weight and draft only.
    Note: "Grain capacity unknown." Reduce confidence.

  Missing SF:
    Skip cubature modifier. Note: "SF unknown."
    
  Vessel way too big (intake > max_qty × 3):
    Apply over-cargo penalty. P5_base will be 2-4.
    offer_hint: "Vessel far too large for this parcel."
                   
  Vessel way too small (intake < min_qty × 0.5):
    BLOCK. offer_hint: "Vessel far too small — do not offer."

================================================================================
AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Follow all 5 steps in order
    - Show calculation in reasoning (numbers, not just words)
    - Identify the limiting factor (weight/volume/draft)
    - Check BOTH port_restrictions_map AND cargo description for draft limits
    - Apply vessel utilization penalty when restrictions reduce capacity
    - Apply cubature modifier only when SF > 47
    - Note that draft BLOCK is a P5 BLOCK (not P8)
    
  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never skip Step 1 (cargo quantity parsing)
    - ❌ Never forget ROB deduction (250t)
    - ❌ Never ignore draft restrictions from cargo description
    - ❌ Never apply cubature penalty when SF <= 47
    - ❌ Never give score below 2 (except BLOCK)
    - ❌ Never put draft restrictions in P8 — they belong in P5
    - ❌ Never assume volume_intake when grain capacity is missing

port_restrictions_map

Short Summary — Port Restrictions Map

This file contains the physical and operational limitations of ports, terminals, and regions.
It defines what a vessel can or cannot do in a specific port based on:

Draft restrictions

LOA / Beam limits

Water type (fresh / brackish / sea)

Seasonal restrictions (ice, low water, draft reduction)

Gear requirements (required / preferred / optional)

Maximum vessel size (typical DWT ranges)

Terminal-level depth and operational constraints

It also includes regional-level patterns, explaining where gear is typically required (Africa, Red Sea, Asia) or rarely needed (Black Sea, America).

This file is the authoritative source for all port-related compatibility checks in the VK Charts AI scoring system.

▶️ How to Use — Short Instructions
1. Use this file to check whether the vessel can physically load/discharge

AI must compare:

vessel draft

LOA

beam

presence/absence of vessel gear

with the port’s restrictions.

If any restriction is violated →
AI must assign a low score or mark the vessel incompatible for this cargo.

2. Apply regional patterns when port-level data is missing

If a specific port is not in the file:

Use region_patterns (e.g., “Africa → gear required”)

This acts as a fallback rule to avoid incorrect assumptions

3. Use seasonal rules for ports like Izmail/Reni

AI must adjust scoring if:

winter ice requires ice-class

low water reduces draft

Danube limitations restrict DWT

These conditions directly influence vessel–cargo compatibility.

4. Use gear_requirement rules for cargo types

Example:
Sugar in bags → vessel gear required (both ends).
If the vessel has no gear → −20 penalty.

This connects port restrictions with cargo-specific requirements.

5. Determine maximum vessel size compatibility

File provides typical DWT limits:

Odessa/Constanta → up to Panamax

Izmail/Reni → ~3–8K DWT

Egypt Med ports → 5–20K DWT

AI must ensure vessel DWT is within the acceptable range.

6. Use “aliases” for correct port matching

Odessa, Chornomorsk, Ilyichevsk → same port group.
Constanta → may require gear only during roadstead ops.

This prevents false negatives in matching.

# PROXIMITY SCORING MATRIX - UPDATED v2.0
# VK Charts AI Scoring System - Criterion P1
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# CHANGES IN v2.0:
# - Updated East Med scoring (Level 9): 8 → 15 internal for Coasters (~6 P1)
# - Updated Adriatic scoring (Level 10): 4 → 17 internal for Coasters (~7 P1)
# - Added vessel size multipliers for all categories
# - Aligned with broker corrections (Adriatic/East Med are viable for coasters)
#
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

version: "2.0"
date: "2026-01-19"
priority: "CRITICAL - Distance directly impacts commercial viability"

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SHORT SUMMARY
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

purpose: |
  This file defines P1 (Proximity) scoring - how AI evaluates geographic
  distance compatibility between vessel's current position and cargo's
  loading port. P1 contributes 0-20 points to the total score (100 max).
  
  WHAT THIS FILE CONTAINS:
  
  1. INTERNAL SCORING LEVELS (0-50 internal points)
     - Level 1: Same port = 50 internal points
     - Level 7: Marmara Sea = 20 internal points
     - Level 10: Adriatic = 17 internal points (UPDATED!)
     - These are SCALED to final P1 range [0, 20]
  
  2. VESSEL SIZE MULTIPLIERS (NEW!)
     - Small Coaster (3-6k): ×0.8 (more sensitive to distance)
     - Coaster (6-8k): ×1.0 (baseline)
     - Small Handy (8-17k): ×1.15
     - Handy (17-24k): ×1.3
     - Large vessels (24k+): ×1.5
  
  3. DISTANCE PENALTIES
     - Fine-tuning based on actual nautical miles within same level
     - Penalty per 100nm varies by vessel size
  
  4. GEOPOLITICAL RESTRICTIONS
     - Ukraine-Russia war sanctions (IMPOSSIBLE scoring)
  
  5. AI USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
     - Step-by-step scoring process

# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# SCORING PRINCIPLE
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

scoring_principle: |
  Proximity = Lower ballast cost = Higher score
  
  Чем ближе судно к порту погрузки, тем выше score
  
  INTERNAL SCORING: 0-50 points (used for detailed level differentiation)
  FINAL P1 SCORE: 0-20 points (scaled from internal score)
  
  Scaling formula: P1_final = (internal_score / 50) * 20

VESSEL LOCATION DETERMINATION
Version: 4.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Determine the vessel's current position, heading, and operational status
  to support P1 (proximity), P7 (readiness/ETA), and offer generation.
  Includes draught analysis for ballast/laden detection.

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  This file provides draught analysis logic that P7 MUST use     ║
  ║  before scoring readiness. See READINESSETA_TO_LOADING_PORT_    ║
  ║  SCORING.txt for how results feed into P7 scoring.             ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

================================================================================
POSITION SOURCES (priority order)
================================================================================

  1. OpenArea data (vessel listing):
     - open_area: "Montoir, Feb 17"
     - Contains: location name, date, sometimes heading
     
  2. VesselFinder / MarineTraffic data:
     - current-position: lat/lon
     - destination: next port
     - eta: estimated arrival
     - navigation-status: "under way", "at anchor", "moored"
     - current-draught: current draught reading (meters)
     
  3. Vessel JSON fields:
     - vessel_area: general area description
     - last_ports: recent port calls with dates

================================================================================
DETERMINING VESSEL READY DATE
================================================================================

  OPTION A — Open area with date only (no destination):
    Example: "open Montoir Feb 17"
    vessel_ready = Feb 17 (use as-is)
    No buffer needed — vessel is stated as open.

  OPTION B — Destination with ETA:
    Example: "heading Ravenna ETA Feb 13"
    
    Step 1: Perform DRAUGHT ANALYSIS (see below)
    Step 2: Apply operations buffer based on result
    
    BALLAST → vessel_ready = ETA (no buffer)
    LADEN   → vessel_ready = ETA + 7 days
    OVER_DRAFT → vessel_ready = ETA + 7 days (treat as laden)
      
  OPTION C — Current position only (no destination/ETA):
    Estimate sailing time from current position to load port.
    Use 10-12 knots average. Add 1 day port entry buffer.
    confidence = "low"

================================================================================
DRAUGHT ANALYSIS — BALLAST/LADEN DETECTION
================================================================================

  FORMULA:
    draught_ratio = current_draught / max_draft
    
    current_draught = field "current-draught" (from AIS/VesselFinder)
    max_draft = field "draft" (summer draft from vessel specs)
    
  THRESHOLDS:
  
    ratio < 0.65 → STATUS: BALLAST
    ────────────────────────────────────────
      Vessel is empty or nearly empty.
      operations_buffer = 0 days
      vessel_ready = ETA
      Ask owner: "Is she proceeding for loading or available?"

    ratio >= 0.65 → STATUS: LADEN
    ────────────────────────────────────────
      Vessel is carrying cargo, heading to discharge.
      operations_buffer = +7 days (discharge + preparation)
      vessel_ready = ETA + 7 days

    current_draught > max_draft → STATUS: OVER_DRAFT
    ────────────────────────────────────────
      Data anomaly (outdated AIS, tropical marks, error).
      Treat as LADEN (conservative).
      operations_buffer = +7 days
      Note data anomaly, confidence = "medium"

  MISSING DATA:
    If current_draught unavailable → default to LADEN (conservative)
    If max_draft unavailable → cannot calculate, use context clues
    Always note missing data in reasoning.

================================================================================
IMPACT ON OTHER CRITERIA
================================================================================

  P7 (Readiness/ETA):
    BALLAST → vessel_ready = ETA → closer to layday = better P7
    LADEN → vessel_ready = ETA + 7 → later ready date = worse P7
    P7 MUST use this analysis. See READINESSETA_TO_LOADING_PORT_SCORING.txt

  P1 (Proximity):
    Use DESTINATION port for distance when vessel is underway
    (not current mid-sea position)

  Offer Opening:
    BALLAST → include question about availability/status
    LADEN → standard approach, mention post-discharge timing

================================================================================
EXAMPLES
================================================================================

  Example 1: OVER_DRAFT (laden)
    current_draught = 8.8m, max_draft = 8.6m
    ratio = 1.023 → OVER_DRAFT → treat as LADEN
    vessel_ready = ETA + 7 days
    Note: "Draught 8.8m exceeds max 8.6m — anomaly, treating as laden."

  Example 2: BALLAST
    current_draught = 2.1m, max_draft = 5.2m  
    ratio = 0.404 → BALLAST
    vessel_ready = ETA (no buffer)
    Ask: "Confirm if heading for loading or open."

  Example 3: LADEN
    current_draught = 7.5m, max_draft = 9.8m
    ratio = 0.765 → LADEN
    vessel_ready = ETA + 7 days

  Example 4: No draught data
    current_draught = not available
    Default: LADEN (+7 days buffer)
    Note: "No draught data — defaulting to laden."
    confidence = "medium"

# PROXIMITY SCORING — DWT MULTIPLIER RANGES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# IMPORTANT: proximity_scoring_matrix.txt uses finer DWT ranges for
# distance sensitivity multipliers. These are SUB-RANGES within the
# main categories above. AI must use these DWT ranges (not category
# names) when applying proximity multipliers:
#
#   DWT 0-6,000:      multiplier 0.8  (very sensitive to distance)
#   DWT 6,001-8,000:  multiplier 1.0  (baseline — reference coaster)
#   DWT 8,001-17,000: multiplier 1.15 (less sensitive)
#   DWT 17,001-24,000: multiplier 1.3  (moderate tolerance)
#   DWT 24,001+:      multiplier 1.5  (high tolerance)
#
# These multipliers apply to proximity levels 8+ (long distance).
# Levels 1-7 (short distance) use base scores without multiplier.
#
# EXAMPLE: Vessel DWT 16,000
#   Main category: Coaster (C: 4,001-17,000)
#   Proximity multiplier: 1.15 (DWT 8,001-17,000 range)
