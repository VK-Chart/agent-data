### 1. Scoring Breakdown

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1: Proximity** | **11.0/20** | 20 | Vessel is in the Azov Sea. Ballast to the Danube (Reni) is ~450nm. For a Small Coaster (SC), this is a moderate ballast leg. |
| **P1A: Regional Patterns** | **12/15** | 15 | Azov/Black Sea to East Med (Greece) is a standard trade pattern for this vessel size. |
| **P2: Owner Preferences** | **5/15** | 15 | Company comments state "ukr ok sometimes" and "ukr expensive." This indicates a neutral-to-cautious willingness to work Ukraine. |
| **P3: Cargo Preferences** | **12/15** | 15 | SBS (SF 51) is a standard agricultural bulk cargo. Vessel is a General Cargo ship suitable for this type. |
| **P4: Last Ports** | **1/10** | 10 | No specific port call history provided; score based on company's general regional familiarity. |
| **P5: Intake Capacity** | **3/15** | 15 | **CRITICAL:** Volume limitation. With a grain capacity of 140,659 cuft and SF 51, max intake is ~2,758t. This is only 92% of the 3,000t requirement. |
| **P6: OpenArea Modifier** | **0** | +/- | No voyage-specific comments provided. |
| **P7: Readiness/ETA** | **7/10** | 10 | Based on position in Azov Sea and 8kn speed, vessel can reach Reni in ~2.5 days, well within the Jan 12-20 laycan. |

### 2. Detailed Reasoning & Analysis

**Geographic Analysis (P1/P1A):**
The vessel is currently located in the **Azov Sea**. To reach the loading port of **Reni (Ukraine Danube)**, it must transit the Kerch Strait and cross the Black Sea. For a vessel of 3,217 DWT (Category: **Small Coaster**), a 450nm ballast leg is commercially acceptable but represents a significant portion of the voyage's total distance. The trade route from the Danube to Crete is a high-frequency pattern for this size class.

**Intake & Technical Fit (P5):**
*   **Weight:** The vessel's DWT (3,217) minus standard ROB (4% ≈ 128t) leaves ~3,089t capacity. This technically fits the 3,000t base quantity.
*   **Volume (The Bottleneck):** The cargo has a high Stowage Factor (SF) of **51**. The vessel's grain capacity is **140,659 cuft**. 
    *   *Calculation:* $140,65
