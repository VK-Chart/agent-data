MASTER SCORING SYSTEM
Version: 4.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Central scoring framework for vessel-cargo matching. Defines all criteria,
  dynamic score calculation, priority order, P9 relationship check, and 
  offer opening generation logic.

================================================================================
ALL CRITERIA — OVERVIEW

================================================================================
DYNAMIC MAX_SCORE CALCULATION
================================================================================

  Not all criteria are always active. Some criteria produce 0/0 when there
  is no data — these are EXCLUDED from the total, not penalized.

  ALWAYS ACTIVE (max_score is always set):
    P1  = 20
    P1A = 15
    P2A = 20
    P4  = 10
    P5  = 15
    P7  = 10
    ────────
    Base always-active MAX = 90

  DYNAMIC (max_score = 0 if no data, otherwise max):
    P2  = 15 or 0 (no owner preference data → excluded)
    P3  = 15 or 0 (no cargo preference data → excluded)
    P6  = 15 or 0 (no OpenArea comments → excluded)
    P8  = 20 or 0 (no restrictions set → excluded)

  FORMULA:
    dynamic_max_score = SUM of max_score for ALL criteria where max_score > 0
    
    Minimum: 90 (only always-active criteria)
    Maximum: 90 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 20 = 155 (all criteria active)

  FINAL SCORE:
    total_score_raw = SUM of all active criteria scores
    total_score = ROUND((total_score_raw / dynamic_max_score) × 100, 1)
    
    Always expressed as percentage: 100% = perfect match

================================================================================
EVALUATION PRIORITY ORDER
================================================================================

  Evaluate in this order (highest impact first):
  
  1. P8  — Restrictions Compliance (BLOCK potential)
  2. P2A — PSC Port Accessibility (BLOCK potential)
  3. P3  — Cargo Preferences
  4. P2  — Owner Preferences (BLOCK potential for "no X")
  5. P6  — OpenArea Comments
  6. P4  — Last Ports
  7. P1A — Regional Patterns
  8. P1  — Proximity (BLOCK for non-viable distances)
  9. P5  — Intake / Cargo Fit (BLOCK potential)
  10. P7  — Readiness / ETA (BLOCK for missed laycan)
  11. P9  — Relationship Check (warning only, no score)

================================================================================
BLOCK LOGIC
================================================================================

  Any criterion can produce a BLOCK. A single BLOCK = vessel is not viable.
  
  When BLOCK is triggered:
    - recommendation = "BLOCKED"
    - Still score ALL other criteria (for informational value)
    - Mark blocked criterion with "decision": "blocked", "critical": true
    - short_summary explains why vessel is blocked
    - Offer opening is NOT generated (or marked as "do not offer")

  Multiple BLOCKs: Report all. Summary mentions the most impactful.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION CATEGORIES
================================================================================

  Based on total_score (percentage):

  BLOCKED — One or more criteria triggered BLOCK
    → Do not offer
    
  STRONG (80%+) — Excellent match
    → Offer with confidence, intent = ATTRACT
    
  GOOD (65-80%) — Solid match with minor issues
    → Offer proactively, intent = ATTRACT or INQUIRE
    
  CONDITIONAL (50-65%) — Decent match, has concerns
    → Offer with questions, intent = INQUIRE
    
  WEAK (35-50%) — Poor match but may work
    → Offer for information gathering, intent = INFORM
    
  SKIP (<35%) — Not worth offering
    → Skip unless desperate for tonnage

================================================================================
P9 — RELATIONSHIP CHECK (WARNING ONLY)
================================================================================

  P9 is NOT a scoring criterion. It generates a warning flag that influences
  the offer approach but does not affect total_score.

  PURPOSE: Detect if the vessel owner has a known relationship with the 
  charterer (cargo account) — either direct or through another broker.

  DATA SOURCES:
    - Company/vessel/person comments (current format)
    - Dedicated relationship field (future, when available)
    - Any structured data about owner-charterer connections
    
  PARSING NOTE:
    AI should check ALL available sources for relationship data.
    Source format may change — logic remains the same:
    Find mentions of charterer names, broker names, "works direct with X"

  WARNING TYPES:

    DIRECT_RELATIONSHIP
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
      Trigger: Owner works directly with this charterer
      Example comment: "works direct with Bunge"
      Cargo account: "Bunge"
      Warning: "⚠️ Owner works directly with Bunge. They may already have 
               this cargo or prefer direct communication."
      Offer impact: Be careful — don't offer cargo they may already know 
               about. Consider mentioning "in case you haven't seen this yet"
               
    BROKER_RELATIONSHIP
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
      Trigger: Owner works through specific broker for this charterer
      Example comment: "Cargill cargoes via Clarkson"
      Cargo account: "Cargill"
      Warning: "⚠️ Owner handles Cargill cargoes through Clarkson."
      Offer impact: Owner may not respond or redirect to their broker.
               Adjust expectations.
               
    NO_RELATIONSHIP (CLEAR)
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
      Trigger: No known connection found
      Warning: null
      Offer impact: Standard approach

  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  
    When warning found:
    "relationship_warning": {
      "status": "WARNING",
      "type": "direct_relationship",
      "details": "Owner works directly with Bunge (from company comments)",
      "offer_guidance": "They may already have this cargo. Approach carefully."
    }
    
    When no relationship found:
    "relationship_warning": {
      "status": "CLEAR"
    }

================================================================================
OFFER OPENING GENERATION
================================================================================

  After scoring all criteria, generate an offer opening line for both 
  email and messenger formats. The offer opening is a ready-to-use phrase
  for the beginning of the communication to the owner.
  
  See: OFFER_OPENING_STYLE_GUIDE.txt for detailed style rules and examples.

  GENERATION LOGIC:

  1. Determine INTENT based on total_score:
     - ATTRACT (70%+): Confident, enthusiastic, lead with strengths
     - INQUIRE (50-70%): Balanced, show cargo + ask key questions
     - INFORM (<50%): Cautious, "for your reference", gather info
     
  2. Extract KEY SELLING POINTS from high-scoring criteria (offer_hints)
  
  3. Extract KEY CONCERNS from low-scoring/critical criteria (offer_hints)
  
  4. Extract QUESTIONS TO ASK from missing data or unclear points
  
  5. Generate email_text (2-4 sentences, shipping English, abbreviations)
  
  6. Generate messenger_text (1-2 sentences, max abbreviations, no sign-off)

  OUTPUT FORMAT:
  
  "offer_opening": {
    "intent": "attract",
    "email_text": "Pls find below cargo details which we believe suits mv 
                   Example perfectly — she's well positioned and timing aligns 
                   nicely. Kindly let us know yr interest/ideas.",
    "messenger_text": "hi, have a nice cargo for Example — good position, 
                       good timing. pls see below, lmk if interested?",
    "key_selling_points": ["proximity", "timing"],
    "key_concerns": ["intake slightly tight"],
    "questions_to_ask": []
  }
  
  IMPORTANT: 
    - NO greetings in offer_opening text (greetings handled separately)
    - Use authentic shipping abbreviations (see OFFER_OPENING_STYLE_GUIDE.txt)
    - Never sound like AI — sound like a colleague sharing an opportunity
    - When BLOCKED: offer_opening not generated (or intent = "do_not_offer")

AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Evaluate ALL criteria, even when BLOCK is found early
    - Calculate dynamic_max_score correctly (only active criteria)
    - Generate offer_hint for each criterion
    - Perform P9 relationship check
    - Generate offer_opening (unless BLOCKED)
    - Use short, natural reasoning (not verbose)
    - Express total_score as percentage
    
  ai_must_not:
    - Never include criteria with max_score = 0 in the denominator
    - Never skip criteria evaluation
    - Never generate offer_opening when vessel is BLOCKED
    - Never include greetings in offer_opening text
    - Never let P9 affect the numerical score
    - Never use overly formal or AI-sounding language in summaries
