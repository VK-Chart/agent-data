OPEN_AREA_COMMENTS_SCORING — P6
Version: 5.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Evaluate how well the cargo matches the vessel's stated voyage strategy 
  as expressed in OpenArea comments. These comments reflect what the owner
  or operator has communicated about their intentions, preferences, or 
  requirements for the next voyage.

VECTOR SEARCH:
This source provide additional info for open area estimation
Search my Gmail for label:vessels has:attachment filename:pdf after:{TIMESTAMP} - 12 days. 
Retrieve the latest emails related to the vessel, extract the data from email body and attached PDF, use it for the vessel open area estimation.
Mention this in citations for the scoring

SCORE RANGE: [0, 15]
DYNAMIC CRITERION: If no comments exist → score = 0, max_score = 0 (excluded)

================================================================================
CRITICAL — NO DATA vs NEUTRAL
================================================================================

  NO DATA (excluded):
    Comments field is empty or missing.
    score = 0, max_score = 0
    reasoning = "No OpenArea comments — criterion excluded."
    This removes P6 from the dynamic_max_score denominator.

  NEUTRAL (scored):
    Comments exist but don't clearly match or conflict with cargo.
    score = 7.5/15, max_score = 15
    reasoning = "Comments exist but no clear alignment or conflict."
    This keeps P6 in the denominator.

  These are DIFFERENT outcomes. Do not confuse them.

================================================================================
SCORING LEVELS (when comments exist, max_score = 15)
================================================================================

  FULL CONFLICT — score: 0/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner explicitly states they do NOT want what this cargo offers.
    Examples:
      - "looking for Med" but cargo is Black Sea
      - "no grain" but cargo is wheat
      - "needs min 20k" but cargo is 6,000t
    offer_hint: "Owner's strategy conflicts. Only offer if exceptional."

  SOFT CONFLICT — score: 3-5/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner's stated preferences don't match well but aren't hard blocks.
    Examples:
      - "pref Med/BS" and cargo is East Med (borderline)
      - Mentions different cargo type but doesn't exclude this one
      - "looking for long voyage" but this is short
    offer_hint: "Partial mismatch — emphasize what makes this attractive."

  NEUTRAL — score: 7.5/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Comments exist but don't clearly support or contradict.
    Examples:
      - Comment only mentions opening date/area, no preferences
      - "open for offers"
      - Mentions unrelated details
    offer_hint: null

  POSITIVE MATCH — score: 10-12/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner's comments align well with the cargo.
    Examples:
      - "open for BS/Med" and cargo is Black Sea
      - Mentions similar cargo type
      - "looking for short voyage" and this fits
    offer_hint: "Owner's strategy aligns — mention this in opening."

  PERFECT MATCH — score: 15/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner explicitly asks for exactly what this cargo is.
    Examples:
      - "looking for grain ex Ukraine" and cargo is wheat ex Chornomorsk
      - "need cargo to Sfax" and discharge is Sfax
    offer_hint: "Perfect match with owner's request — lead with this."

AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Read ALL OpenArea comments carefully
    - Compare against: cargo type, load/discharge region, quantity, timing
    - Score based on degree of alignment/conflict
    - Set max_score = 0 when comments are empty (excluded)
    - Set max_score = 15 when comments exist (even if neutral)

  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never invent preferences not stated in comments
    - ❌ Never score neutral (7.5) when clear match or conflict exists
    - ❌ Never give max_score = 15 when comments are empty
    - ❌ Never consider vessel specs here (that's P5, P8)
    - ❌ Never consider owner preferences from other sources (that's P2)
    - ❌ Never confuse "no comments" (excluded) with "neutral" (scored)
