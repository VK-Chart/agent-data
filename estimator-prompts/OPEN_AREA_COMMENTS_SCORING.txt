OPEN_AREA_COMMENTS_SCORING — P6
Version: 4.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Evaluate how well the cargo matches the vessel's stated voyage strategy 
  as expressed in OpenArea comments. These comments reflect what the owner
  or operator has communicated about their intentions, preferences, or 
  requirements for the next voyage.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 15]
DYNAMIC CRITERION: If no comments exist → score = 0, max_score = 0 (excluded from total)

================================================================================
CRITICAL RULE — NO DATA HANDLING
================================================================================

  If the vessel has NO OpenArea comments (empty or missing):
    score = 0
    max_score = 0
    reasoning = "No OpenArea comments available — criterion excluded from scoring."
    offer_hint = null
    
  RATIONALE: Absence of data should not inflate or deflate the total score.
  The criterion is simply excluded from the dynamic MAX_SCORE calculation.
  This is different from "neutral" — neutral means data exists but doesn't
  help or hurt.

================================================================================
SCORING LEVELS (when comments exist, max_score = 15)
================================================================================

  FULL CONFLICT — score: 0/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner explicitly states they do NOT want what this cargo offers.
    Examples:
      - Comment says "looking for Med" but cargo is Black Sea
      - Comment says "no grain" but cargo is wheat
      - Comment says "needs min 20k" but cargo is 6,000t
    offer_hint: "Owner's stated strategy conflicts with this cargo. Only offer 
                 if exceptional circumstances justify it. Acknowledge their preference."

  SOFT CONFLICT — score: 3-5/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner's stated preferences don't match well but aren't hard blocks.
    Examples:
      - Comment says "pref Med/BS" and cargo is East Med (borderline)
      - Comment mentions a different cargo type but doesn't exclude this one
      - Comment says "looking for long voyage" but this is short
    offer_hint: "Partial mismatch with owner's stated preferences. Emphasize 
                 what makes this cargo attractive despite the mismatch."

  NEUTRAL — score: 7.5/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Comments exist but don't clearly support or contradict this cargo.
    Examples:
      - Comment only mentions opening date/area, no preferences
      - Comment is generic ("open for offers")
      - Comment mentions unrelated details
    offer_hint: null (no specific guidance needed)

  POSITIVE MATCH — score: 10-12/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner's comments align well with what this cargo offers.
    Examples:
      - Comment says "open for BS/Med" and cargo is Black Sea
      - Comment mentions similar cargo type
      - Comment says "looking for short voyage" and this fits
    offer_hint: "Owner's strategy aligns with this cargo — mention this alignment 
                 in the opening."

  PERFECT MATCH — score: 15/15
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Owner explicitly asks for exactly what this cargo is.
    Examples:
      - Comment says "looking for grain ex Ukraine" and cargo is wheat ex Chornomorsk
      - Comment says "need cargo to Sfax" and discharge is Sfax
      - Comment mentions the exact charterer or cargo type
    offer_hint: "Perfect match with owner's stated strategy — lead with this. 
                 Cargo is exactly what they asked for."

AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Read ALL OpenArea comments carefully
    - Compare comments against: cargo type, load region, discharge region, 
      quantity range, voyage duration, laycan timing
    - Score based on degree of alignment/conflict
    - Generate offer_hint based on the scoring outcome
    - Set max_score = 0 when no comments exist

  ai_must_not:
    - Never invent or assume preferences not stated in comments
    - Never score neutral (7.5) when there is a clear match or conflict
    - Never give max_score = 15 when comments are empty
    - Never consider vessel specifications here (that's P5, P8)
    - Never consider owner preferences from other sources here (that's P2)

================================================================================
DATA SOURCES
================================================================================

    - Quantity preferences: "needs min 15k", "looking for full cargo"
    - Voyage preferences: "short voyage", "TC out", "trip to Far East"
