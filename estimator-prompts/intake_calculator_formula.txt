INTAKE CALCULATOR FORMULA — P5
Version: 5.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Calculate vessel's cargo intake capacity and score how well the vessel 
  fits the cargo quantity requirements. Multi-step process covering weight,
  volume, draft restrictions, vessel utilization, and cubature.

  P5 is the ONLY criterion that handles draft/draught restrictions.
  Draft restrictions are NEVER scored in P8. If cargo mentions "draft 7.5m
  limit", that restriction is processed here in P5.

SCORE RANGE: [0, 15]
ALWAYS ACTIVE: max_score = 15
MINIMUM SCORE: 2 (except when BLOCK)

================================================================================
STEP 1 — PARSE CARGO QUANTITY (min_qty / max_qty)
================================================================================

  Convert cargo quantity description into numeric min/max range:
  
  "15,000t +/-10%"     → min 13,500 / max 16,500
  "6000/6600t"         → min 6,000 / max 6,600
  "6000t MOLOO"        → min 5,700 / max 6,300 (±5%)
  "6000t" (no qualifier) → min 5,700 / max 6,300 (assume ±5%)
  "15,000mt 10% MOLOO" → min 13,500 / max 16,500
  "abt 8,000t"         → min 7,600 / max 8,400 (±5%)

================================================================================
STEP 2 — CALCULATE VESSEL INTAKE
================================================================================

  A) WEIGHT INTAKE:
     weight_intake = DWT - ROB
     ROB (Remaining On Board) = 250 tonnes (default fuel/water/stores)
     
     If DWT is not available → BLOCK with note "Missing DWT data"
     
  B) VOLUME INTAKE (if stowage factor and grain capacity known):
     volume_intake = grain_capacity / SF
     
     grain_capacity = from vessel specs (cubic feet)
     SF = Stowage Factor of the cargo (cubic feet per tonne)
     
     Common SF values:
       Wheat: 46-48 cbft/t       Corn/Maize: 47-50 cbft/t
       Barley: 49-53 cbft/t      Soybeans: 48-50 cbft/t
       Cement: 28-30 cbft/t      Coal: 42-48 cbft/t
       Fertilizer (urea): 42-45  Sugar: 38-42 cbft/t
       Steel products: 15-25     Rice: 42-52 cbft/t
       
     If grain_capacity or SF not available → skip volume check
     
  C) DRAFT-RESTRICTED INTAKE (when port or cargo has draft restriction):
  
     DRAFT RESTRICTION SOURCES (use the MORE restrictive value):
       1. port_restrictions_map.txt — physical port depth limit
       2. Cargo description — charterer-imposed draft limit
       
     If BOTH sources exist, use: MIN(port_limit, cargo_limit)
     If neither exists → no draft restriction applies
     
     FORMULA (simplified linear approximation):
       draft_ratio = port_max_draft / vessel_max_draft
       draft_restricted_intake = weight_intake × draft_ratio
       
     Note: This is a LINEAR approximation. Actual DWT/draft relationship
     is non-linear (depends on vessel hull design). For screening purposes
     this approximation is acceptable. Actual intake must be confirmed
     with the owner.
       
     If no draft restriction → draft_restricted_intake = unlimited
     
  D) FINAL INTAKE:
     final_intake = MIN(weight_intake, volume_intake, draft_restricted_intake)
     
     Record which factor is limiting: weight / volume / draft

================================================================================
STEP 3 — CARGO FIT SCORE (base P5 score)
================================================================================

  Compare final_intake to cargo min_qty / max_qty:
  
  PERFECT FIT: min_qty <= final_intake <= max_qty
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    P5_base = 15/15
    offer_hint: "Cargo fits vessel perfectly."
    
  UNDER CARGO: final_intake < min_qty
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    shortfall = 1 - (final_intake / min_qty)
    penalty = shortfall × 2.0
    P5_base = MAX(15 × (1 - penalty), 2)
    
    BLOCK CONDITION: final_intake < min_qty × 0.85
      → Vessel physically cannot load minimum required cargo
      → P5 = BLOCK
      
    offer_hint: "Intake below cargo minimum — be transparent about qty."
    
  OVER CARGO: final_intake > max_qty
  ─────────────────────────────────────────
    excess = 1 - (max_qty / final_intake)
    penalty = excess × 2.0
    P5_base = MAX(15 × (1 - penalty), 2)
    
    Note: No BLOCK for over-cargo — vessel can always load less.
    But penalized because owner won't want to waste capacity.
    
    offer_hint: "Vessel larger than needed — emphasize attractive rate."

================================================================================
STEP 4 — VESSEL UTILIZATION PENALTY (additional modifier)
================================================================================

  PURPOSE: Penalize when external restrictions prevent vessel from using
  full capacity. Owner is less interested if vessel can only load 70%.
  
  APPLIES WHEN: Draft restriction or grain capacity limits reduce intake.
  
  FORMULA:
    unrestricted_intake = MIN(weight_intake, volume_intake)
    restricted_intake = MIN(weight_intake, volume_intake, draft_restricted_intake)
    
    restriction_ratio = restricted_intake / unrestricted_intake
    
    If restriction_ratio >= 0.85: no additional penalty
    
    If restriction_ratio < 0.85:
      vessel_util_penalty = (0.85 - restriction_ratio) × 1.5
      P5_score = P5_base × (1 - vessel_util_penalty)

================================================================================
STEP 5 — CUBATURE MODIFIER (for voluminous cargoes)
================================================================================

  APPLIES WHEN: SF > 47 (cargo is voluminous)
  
  FORMULA:
    cubature_ratio = volume_intake / weight_intake
    
    If cubature_ratio >= 0.85: no penalty
    
    If cubature_ratio < 0.85:
      cubature_penalty = (0.85 - cubature_ratio) × 1.5
      P5_score = P5_score × (1 - cubature_penalty)

================================================================================
FINAL P5 SCORE
================================================================================

  P5 = MAX(P5_score after all modifiers, 2)
  Unless BLOCK → then P5 = BLOCK
  
  BLOCK CONDITIONS:
    - final_intake < min_qty × 0.85 (vessel physically too small)
    - Missing DWT data
    
  Note: Draft restriction causing BLOCK in P5 means the vessel cannot
  physically load the cargo at the restricted draft. This is a P5 BLOCK,
  not a P8 BLOCK. P8 does NOT handle draft restrictions.

================================================================================
COMPLETE EXAMPLE — ADAMAR + WHEAT
================================================================================

  Cargo: wheat 15,000t +/-10% ex Chornomorsk, SF = 47, port draft 7.5m
  Vessel: ADAMAR, DWT 16,653, draft 8.6m, grain capacity 694,700 cbft
  
  Step 1: min_qty = 13,500, max_qty = 16,500
  
  Step 2:
    weight_intake = 16653 - 250 = 16,403
    volume_intake = 694700 / 47 = 14,781
    draft_restricted = 16403 × (7.5/8.6) = 14,305
    final_intake = MIN(16403, 14781, 14305) = 14,305 (draft-limited)
    
  Step 3: 13,500 <= 14,305 <= 16,500 → PERFECT FIT, P5_base = 15
    
  Step 4: unrestricted = 14,781 / restricted = 14,305
    ratio = 0.968 → no penalty
    
  Step 5: SF = 47, not > 47 → skipped
    
  Final P5 = 15/15

================================================================================
COMPLETE EXAMPLE — SMALL VESSEL + DRAFT RESTRICTION
================================================================================

  Cargo: wheat 8,000t +/-5%, SF = 47, port draft 6.0m
  Vessel: DWT 6,800, draft 7.2m, grain capacity 220,000 cbft
  
  Step 1: min_qty = 7,600, max_qty = 8,400
  
  Step 2:
    weight_intake = 6800 - 250 = 6,550
    volume_intake = 220000 / 47 = 4,681
    draft_restricted = 6550 × (6.0/7.2) = 5,458
    final_intake = MIN(6550, 4681, 5458) = 4,681 (volume-limited)
    
  Step 3: 4,681 < 7,600 × 0.85 = 6,460 → BLOCK
  
  Final P5 = BLOCK
  Note: This BLOCK is from P5, not P8. Draft is a P5 matter.

================================================================================
EDGE CASES
================================================================================

  Missing grain capacity:
    Skip volume_intake. Use weight and draft only.
    Note: "Grain capacity unknown." Reduce confidence.

  Missing SF:
    Skip cubature modifier. Note: "SF unknown."
    
  Vessel way too big (intake > max_qty × 3):
    Apply over-cargo penalty. P5_base will be 2-4.
    offer_hint: "Vessel far too large for this parcel."
                   
  Vessel way too small (intake < min_qty × 0.5):
    BLOCK. offer_hint: "Vessel far too small — do not offer."

================================================================================
AI INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

  ai_must:
    - Follow all 5 steps in order
    - Show calculation in reasoning (numbers, not just words)
    - Identify the limiting factor (weight/volume/draft)
    - Check BOTH port_restrictions_map AND cargo description for draft limits
    - Apply vessel utilization penalty when restrictions reduce capacity
    - Apply cubature modifier only when SF > 47
    - Note that draft BLOCK is a P5 BLOCK (not P8)
    
  ai_must_not:
    - ❌ Never skip Step 1 (cargo quantity parsing)
    - ❌ Never forget ROB deduction (250t)
    - ❌ Never ignore draft restrictions from cargo description
    - ❌ Never apply cubature penalty when SF <= 47
    - ❌ Never give score below 2 (except BLOCK)
    - ❌ Never put draft restrictions in P8 — they belong in P5
    - ❌ Never assume volume_intake when grain capacity is missing
