OFFER OPENING STYLE GUIDE
Version: 1.0
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Define the style, tone, abbreviations, and approach for generating offer
  opening lines. These are ready-to-use phrases for the beginning of an 
  email or messenger message to a shipowner about a cargo opportunity.

  IMPORTANT: Offer openings contain NO GREETINGS. Greetings (gm, hi, dear)
  are handled separately with personalization based on company comments,
  nationalities, holidays, and relationship context.

STYLE RULES
================================================================================

  GENERAL:
    - Sound like a REAL BROKER, not like AI
    - Colleague tone — sharing an opportunity, not selling
    - Short sentences, no fluff
    - Use shipping abbreviations naturally (not forced)
    - Be honest about concerns — diplomatic but direct
    - Always include a call to action (lmk, what do you think, yr ideas)
    
  EMAIL FORMAT:
    - 2-4 sentences for the opening/intro paragraph
    - Then cargo details follow (not generated here — just the intro)
    - Sign off: "brgs" or "rgds" (NOT generated in offer_opening)
    - Can reference specific selling points or concerns
    - Slightly more formal than messenger but still shipping casual
    
  MESSENGER FORMAT:
    - 1-2 sentences maximum
    - Maximum abbreviations
    - No sign-off
    - Get to the point immediately
    - Can use lowercase throughout
    - More direct and casual than email

  NEVER DO:
    - Never start with greetings (gm, ga, hi, dear — handled separately)
    - Never sound like a sales pitch or marketing copy
    - Never use "we are pleased to inform you"
    - Never use "we would like to take this opportunity"
    - Never be overly enthusiastic or use exclamation marks
    - Never use "dear sir/madam" style formality
    - Never include the full cargo description in the opening
    - Never use "I hope this email finds you well"

================================================================================
TEMPLATES BY INTENT LEVEL
================================================================================

  NOTE: These are EXAMPLES, not rigid templates. AI should adapt and vary
  the phrasing based on specific circumstances. Never copy-paste the same
  opening for different vessels.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ATTRACT (score 70%+) — vessel is a good match
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Show confidence that cargo fits, encourage quick response.
  Tone: Positive, direct, enthusiastic (but professional)

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo details which we believe suits mv [vessel] 
     nicely — she's well positioned and timing works. Wld appreciate 
     yr freight ideas."
     
    "Pls find below what looks like a very good fit for mv [vessel] —
     nearby, good timing, full cargo. Kindly let us know yr interest."
     
    "Wish to draw yr attention to below cargo for mv [vessel]. She 
     seems perfectly placed for this one. Yr indication pls."

  Messenger examples:
    "have a nice cargo for [vessel] — good position, good timing. 
     pls see below, lmk if interested?"
     
    "smth nice for [vessel] — close by and timing fits. see below, 
     what do you think?"
     
    "cargo that suits [vessel] well — pls check below and lmk yr view"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  INQUIRE (50-70%) — decent match but has questions/concerns
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Show cargo + ask key questions to clarify fit.
  Tone: Interested but cautious, transparent about concerns.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo we'd like to show for mv [vessel]. We note 
     she's opening [area] — cld you kindly confirm her exact opening 
     date/position? Also wld be helpful to know yr view on [topic]."
     
    "Pls find below cargo for mv [vessel]. Position looks reasonable 
     but intake is tight — wld appreciate yr indication on qty 
     flexibility. Yr view pls."
     
    "Wish to show below cargo for mv [vessel]. Timing cld work if she 
     opens as stated. Cld you confirm her current status?"

  Messenger examples:
    "sending you a cargo for [vessel]. can you confirm her opening? 
     also is she ok for [region/cargo]?"
     
    "cargo for [vessel] — position ok but need to check timing. 
     can you confirm when she opens exactly?"
     
    "have smth for [vessel] — looks possible but intake bit tight. 
     pls see below, yr view?"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  INFORM (<50%) — poor match but showing for relationship/info
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Send for reference, gather information, maintain contact.
  Tone: Low-key, honest about limitations, looking for info exchange.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo details for yr good order. We understand mv 
     [vessel] may not be ideal fit at this stage given [reason], hvr 
     sending in case circumstances have changed. Any update on her 
     availability/preferences wld be appreciated."
     
    "Pls find below for yr reference — appreciate this may not be the 
     best match for mv [vessel] but wanted to keep you informed. Wld 
     welcome any update on her trading plans."
     
    "Sending below cargo fyi for mv [vessel]. We note [concern] but 
     wanted to show just in case. Any news on her position/plans?"

  Messenger examples:
    "sending below cargo fyi — understand [vessel] might not fit 
     perfectly but wanted to show just in case. any updates on her?"
     
    "know [region] isn't first choice but sending below just in case —
     any change in plans for [vessel]?"
     
    "cargo fyi for [vessel] — not perfect match but sending for yr 
     reference. any news on her?"

           case you haven't seen this one yet. [rest of opening]"
           
    Messenger: "in case you haven't seen it — cargo below for [vessel]. 
               [rest of opening]"

OFFER_HINT → OFFER_OPENING MAPPING
================================================================================

  The offer_opening is generated by combining offer_hints from individual 
  criteria into a coherent opening phrase. Here's how hints map to opening:

  High-score hints (selling points):
    P1 "well positioned nearby" → "she's well positioned"
    P7 "timing perfect" → "timing works nicely"
    P6 "matches stated strategy" → "fits with yr stated plans"
    P4 "knows the area" → "familiar with these ports"
    
  Low-score hints (concerns to mention diplomatically):
    P5 "intake tight" → "intake is a bit tight"
    P7 "timing tight" → "timing cld be challenging"
    P1 "long ballast" → "appreciate the ballast is significant"
    P2 "region not preferred" → "note [region] may not be first choice"
    
  Missing data hints (questions to ask):
    P2 "no preference data" → "wld be helpful to know yr preferences"
    Draught "ballast confirmation" → "cld you confirm her status?"
    P7 "opening date unclear" → "pls confirm her exact opening"
