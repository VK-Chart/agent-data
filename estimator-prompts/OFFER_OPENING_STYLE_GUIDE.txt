OFFER OPENING STYLE GUIDE
Version: 2.1
Last updated: 2026-02-20
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Define the style, tone, abbreviations, and approach for generating offer
  opening lines. These are ready-to-use phrases for the beginning of an 
  email or messenger message to a shipowner about a cargo opportunity.

  IMPORTANT: Offer openings contain NO GREETINGS. Greetings (gm, hi, dear)
  are handled separately with personalization.

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  Offer opening is ALWAYS generated — even for BLOCKED vessels.  ║
  ║  BLOCKED vessels use intent "blocked_info" (see below).        ║
  ║                                                                ║
  ║  ❌ NEVER use intent "do_not_offer" — always "blocked_info"     ║
  ║  ❌ NEVER write in AI explanation style — always broker-to-owner ║
  ║  ❌ NEVER use "we/us/our" — ALWAYS use "I"                     ║
  ║  ❌ NEVER expose CRM data or vessel limitations                 ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

  WRONG (AI explanation style):
    "Vessel is currently in the Arabian Sea and cannot commercially 
     position for a Black Sea cargo of this size."
  
  WRONG ("we" language):
    "We appreciate she's currently trading Middle East area."
    "We note timing is tight."

  RIGHT (broker-to-owner style, first person "I"):
    "Pls find below cargo for yr reference re mv Princess Masa. 
     I know she's currently trading ME area, hvr sending in case 
     her trading plans change towards BS/Med."

    - Colleague tone — sharing opportunity, not selling
    - Short sentences, no fluff
    - Use shipping abbreviations naturally
    - Be honest about concerns — diplomatic but direct
    - Always include a call to action (lmk, what do you think, yr ideas)
    - ALWAYS use "I" — NEVER "we/us/our"
    
  EMAIL: 2-4 sentences. Slightly more formal than messenger.
  MESSENGER: 1-2 sentences max. Lowercase ok. Maximum abbreviations.

  NEVER:
    - Never start with greetings (handled separately)
    - Never sound like a sales pitch
    - Never use "I am pleased to inform you" or similar formal language
    - Never use exclamation marks
    - Never include full cargo description in opening
    - Never use "we/us/our" — only "I"
    - Never expose CRM data (percentages, statistics, comments)
    - Never expose vessel limitations (intake concerns, class issues, etc.)

================================================================================
TEMPLATES BY INTENT LEVEL
================================================================================

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  BLOCKED_INFO — vessel is blocked but we still generate an opening
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Provide a ready draft in case the block condition changes (laycan
  extends, owner changes mind, market shifts). Broker can decide to send
  or not. Mention the block reason honestly but keep it professional.
  Tone: Cautious, informational, diplomatic.

  BLOCKED BY TIMING (P7):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo for yr reference re mv [vessel]. Timing 
       is tight given her current position, hvr sending in case laycan 
       extends or she frees up earlier. Any update on her schedule 
       wld be appreciated."
       
      "Wish to draw yr attention to below cargo for mv [vessel] — 
       current dates don't quite work but wanted to keep you in the 
       loop for any future adjustments. Yr update on her status pls."
       
      "Pls see below cargo which suits mv [vessel] well on paper — 
       main challenge is timing at this stage. Sending for yr records 
       in case dates adjust. Any news on when she opens?"

    Messenger examples:
      "cargo fyi for [vessel] — timing doesn't work for current laycan
       but sending in case dates extend. any update on when she opens?"
       
      "have a cargo that suits [vessel] but dates are tight. sending 
       in case laycan changes — any news on her schedule?"
       
      "[vessel] — nice cargo but timing is the issue. fyi in case 
       things shift. when does she free up?"

  BLOCKED BY OWNER PREFERENCE (P2):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo details for yr good order re mv [vessel]. 
       I know [region] may not be of primary interest, hvr wanted to 
       show given the cargo otherwise suits her well. Any change in 
       trading plans wld be good to know."
       
    Messenger:
      "know [region] isn't first choice but cargo below suits [vessel] 
       otherwise. sending fyi — any change in plans?"

  BLOCKED BY INTAKE/RESTRICTIONS (P5/P8):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo fyi for mv [vessel]. Sending for yr records 
       and in case there's flexibility on requirements."
       
    Messenger:
      "cargo fyi for [vessel] — sending just in case. any flexibility?"

  P5 BLOCKED BY INTAKE — use "sub intake" pattern:
    Email: "Sending fyi for mv [vessel] sub her intake approval."
    Messenger: "cargo fyi for [vessel] sub her intake. lmk"

  BLOCKED BY DISTANCE (P1):
  
    Email:
      "Pls find below cargo for yr good order re mv [vessel]. I know 
       she's currently trading [area], hvr sending in case her plans 
       change towards [cargo region]. Yr update wld be welcome."
    Messenger:
      "[vessel] — cargo fyi, know she's in [area] but sending in 
       case plans change. any news on her next movements?"

  MULTIPLE BLOCKS:
  
    Email:
      "Pls find below cargo for yr good order re mv [vessel]. Several 
       factors present challenges at this stage, hvr sending for yr 
       reference and in case circumstances change. Any update on 
       [vessel] wld be appreciated."
       
    Messenger:
      "cargo fyi for [vessel] — has a few challenges but sending for 
       reference. any updates?"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ATTRACT (score 70%+) — vessel is a good match
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Show confidence that cargo fits, encourage quick response.
  Tone: Positive, direct, professional.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo which suits mv [vessel] nicely — she's well 
     positioned and timing works. Wld appreciate yr interest."
     
    "Pls find below what looks like a very good fit for mv [vessel] —
     nearby, good timing, full cargo. Lmk yr interest pls."
     
    "Wish to draw yr attention to below cargo for mv [vessel]. She 
     seems perfectly placed for this one. Yr indication pls."

  Messenger examples:
    "have a nice cargo for [vessel] — good position, good timing. 
     pls see below, lmk if interested?"
     
    "smth nice for [vessel] — close by and timing fits. see below, 
     what do you think?"
     
    "cargo that suits [vessel] well — pls check below and lmk yr view"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  INQUIRE (50-70%) — decent match but has questions/concerns
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Show cargo + ask key questions to clarify fit.
  Tone: Interested but cautious, transparent about concerns.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo for mv [vessel]. She's opening [area] — 
     cld you kindly confirm her exact opening date/position?"
     
    "Pls find below cargo for mv [vessel]. Position looks reasonable 
     — cld you confirm her opening? Yr view pls."

  Messenger examples:
    "sending you a cargo for [vessel]. can you confirm her opening? 
     also is she ok for [region]?"
     
    "have smth for [vessel] — looks possible. pls see below, yr view?"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  INFORM (<50%) — poor match but showing for relationship/info
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Send for reference, gather information, maintain contact.
  Tone: Low-key, honest about limitations.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo details for yr good order. I understand mv 
     [vessel] may not be ideal fit at this stage given [reason], hvr 
     sending in case circumstances have changed."
     
    "Sending below cargo fyi for mv [vessel]. Sending just in case. 
     Any news on her position/plans?"

  Messenger examples:
    "sending below cargo fyi — [vessel] might not fit perfectly but 
     wanted to show just in case. any updates on her?"
     
    "cargo fyi for [vessel] — not perfect match but sending for yr 
     reference. any news on her?"

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  VERY EARLY VESSEL (-14d+ before layday)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Maximum intent: "inquire" (usually "inform")
  NEVER use "attract" tone for -14d+ early vessels.

  Email examples:
    "Pls find below cargo for mv [vessel]. I know she has time before 
     the dates — sending for her next voyage if she stays in the area. 
     Maybe fix smth short first then load this after."
     
  Messenger:
    "cargo for [vessel] — dates are later but sending in case she 
     stays in the area. maybe fix smth short first?"

================================================================================
SPECIAL CASES
================================================================================

  BALLAST QUESTION:
    Email: "See she's heading to [destination] — cld you confirm if 
           she's proceeding for loading or available for redirection?"
    Messenger: "[vessel] heading to [dest] — is she fixed or open?"

  RELATIONSHIP WARNING (P9):
    Add: "sending in case you haven't seen this one yet"

  NO DATA ON PREFERENCES:
    Add: "wld be helpful to know yr preferences for cargo/regions"

  AIS NAME MISMATCH:
    FIRST question = "btw AIS shows her as [AIS name] — did you sell 
    yr lady or renamed?"
    This overrides all other questions.
