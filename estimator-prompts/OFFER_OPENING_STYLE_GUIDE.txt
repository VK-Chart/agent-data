OFFER OPENING STYLE GUIDE
Version: 2.0 FINAL
Last updated: 2026-02-07
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
  Define the style, tone, abbreviations, and approach for generating offer
  opening lines. These are ready-to-use phrases for the beginning of an 
  email or messenger message to a shipowner about a cargo opportunity.

  IMPORTANT: Offer openings contain NO GREETINGS. Greetings (gm, hi, dear)
  are handled separately with personalization.

  ╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║  Offer opening is ALWAYS generated — even for BLOCKED vessels.  ║
  ║  BLOCKED vessels use intent "blocked_info" (see below).        ║
  ╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

STYLE RULES
================================================================================

  GENERAL:
    - Sound like a REAL BROKER, not AI
    - Colleague tone — sharing opportunity, not selling
    - Short sentences, no fluff
    - Use shipping abbreviations naturally
    - Be honest about concerns — diplomatic but direct
    - Always include a call to action (lmk, what do you think, yr ideas)
    
  EMAIL: 2-4 sentences. Slightly more formal than messenger.
  MESSENGER: 1-2 sentences max. Lowercase ok. Maximum abbreviations.

  NEVER:
    - Never start with greetings (handled separately)
    - Never sound like a sales pitch
    - Never use "we are pleased to inform you"
    - Never use exclamation marks
    - Never include full cargo description in opening

================================================================================
TEMPLATES BY INTENT LEVEL
================================================================================

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  BLOCKED_INFO — vessel is blocked but we still generate an opening
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Goal: Provide a ready draft in case the block condition changes (laycan
  extends, owner changes mind, market shifts). Broker can decide to send
  or not. Mention the block reason honestly but keep it professional.
  Tone: Cautious, informational, diplomatic.

  BLOCKED BY TIMING (P7):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo for yr reference re mv [vessel]. We note 
       timing is tight given her current position, hvr sending in case 
       laycan extends or she frees up earlier than anticipated. Any 
       update on her schedule wld be appreciated."
       
      "Wish to draw yr attention to below cargo for mv [vessel] — we 
       understand current dates don't quite work but wanted to keep you 
       in the loop for any future adjustments. Yr update on her status 
       wld be welcome."
       
      "Pls see below cargo which suits mv [vessel] well on paper — 
       main challenge is timing at this stage. Sending for yr records 
       in case dates adjust. Any news on when she opens?"

    Messenger examples:
      "cargo fyi for [vessel] — timing doesn't work for current laycan
       but sending in case dates extend. any update on when she opens?"
       
      "have a cargo that suits [vessel] but dates are tight. sending 
       in case laycan changes — any news on her schedule?"
       
      "[vessel] — nice cargo but timing is the issue. fyi in case 
       things shift. when does she free up?"

  BLOCKED BY OWNER PREFERENCE (P2):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo details for yr good order re mv [vessel]. 
       We appreciate [region] may not be of primary interest, hvr wanted 
       to show given the cargo otherwise suits her well. Any change in 
       trading plans wld be good to know."
       
    Messenger:
      "know [region] isn't first choice but cargo below suits [vessel] 
       otherwise. sending fyi — any change in plans?"

  BLOCKED BY INTAKE/RESTRICTIONS (P5/P8):
  
    Email examples:
      "Pls find below cargo fyi for mv [vessel]. We note [specific 
       restriction issue] presents a challenge — sending for yr records 
       and in case there's flexibility on requirements."

       just in case. any flexibility?"

       hvr sending for yr reference and in case circumstances change. 
       Any update on [vessel] wld be appreciated."
       
    Messenger:
      "cargo fyi for [vessel] — has a few challenges ([issue1], 
       [issue2]) but sending for reference. any updates?"
