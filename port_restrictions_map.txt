Short Summary — Port Restrictions Map

This file contains the physical and operational limitations of ports, terminals, and regions.
It defines what a vessel can or cannot do in a specific port based on:

Draft restrictions

LOA / Beam limits

Water type (fresh / brackish / sea)

Seasonal restrictions (ice, low water, draft reduction)

Gear requirements (required / preferred / optional)

Maximum vessel size (typical DWT ranges)

Terminal-level depth and operational constraints

It also includes regional-level patterns, explaining where gear is typically required (Africa, Red Sea, Asia) or rarely needed (Black Sea, America).

This file is the authoritative source for all port-related compatibility checks in the VK Charts AI scoring system.

▶️ How to Use — Short Instructions
1. Use this file to check whether the vessel can physically load/discharge

AI must compare:

vessel draft

LOA

beam

presence/absence of vessel gear

with the port’s restrictions.

If any restriction is violated →
AI must assign a low score or mark the vessel incompatible for this cargo.

2. Apply regional patterns when port-level data is missing

If a specific port is not in the file:

Use region_patterns (e.g., “Africa → gear required”)

This acts as a fallback rule to avoid incorrect assumptions

3. Use seasonal rules for ports like Izmail/Reni

AI must adjust scoring if:

winter ice requires ice-class

low water reduces draft

Danube limitations restrict DWT

These conditions directly influence vessel–cargo compatibility.

4. Use gear_requirement rules for cargo types

Example:
Sugar in bags → vessel gear required (both ends).
If the vessel has no gear → −20 penalty.

This connects port restrictions with cargo-specific requirements.

5. Determine maximum vessel size compatibility

File provides typical DWT limits:

Odessa/Constanta → up to Panamax

Izmail/Reni → ~3–8K DWT

Egypt Med ports → 5–20K DWT

AI must ensure vessel DWT is within the acceptable range.

6. Use “aliases” for correct port matching

Odessa, Chornomorsk, Ilyichevsk → same port group.
Constanta → may require gear only during roadstead ops.

This prevents false negatives in matching.
