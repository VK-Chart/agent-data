ABBREVIATIONS_KNOWLEDGE_BASE

1. Purpose of This Knowledge Base

This Abbreviations Knowledge Base contains all abbreviations used in:

Cargo offers

Follow-up reminders

Email communication

WhatsApp / Teams messages

Internal notes

AI-generated vessel-cargo compatibility summaries

The purpose of this file is to:

Standardize terminology across all communication

Ensure AI always interprets abbreviations correctly

Maintain consistent language in offers and reminders

Reduce text length without losing meaning

Provide clear rules for usage frequency and context

All abbreviations listed in this database follow maritime brokerage communication standards (dry cargo, Black Sea â€“ Med focus).

2. Table Structure (Field Definitions)

Each abbreviation must be stored as a structured entry with the following fields:

2.1 Field: abbreviation name

The exact short form used in communication

Lowercase preferred

No punctuation

Examples:
tt, abt, vsl, frt, cp, wog

2.2 Field: abbreviation meaning

Full meaning of the abbreviation

Clear maritime terminology

Should describe the intended usage, not a dictionary definition

Examples:

vsI â†’ â€œvesselâ€

abt â†’ â€œabout / approximatelyâ€

chrtr â†’ â€œchartererâ€

2.3 Field: FrequencyOfUse

Single-select field describing how often the abbreviation is used in offers/reminders.

Allowed values:

Very Often

AI uses this to prioritize abbreviation usage in generated messages.

2.4 Field: Tags (optional but recommended)

Categories describing the type of meaning.

Allowed tags:

general

vessel

cargo

freight

cp terms

2.5 Field: Examples

Real examples showing how the abbreviation is used in practice.
This strongly improves AI accuracy.

Examples:

User Added

2.7 Field: LastUpdated

Date of the last modification.
Used for audit and AI retraining logic.

3. Format for AI Input (YAML Specification)

All abbreviations should be stored in the following AI-friendly structure:

abbreviations:
  - name: "<abbreviation>"
    meaning: "<full meaning>"
    frequency: "<Very Often | Often | Sometimes | Rare | Never>"
    tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
    examples:
      - "<example sentence>"
    owner: "<System | AI | User Added>"
    last_updated: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"

4. Rules for AI Usage

The AI must follow the rules below when generating messages:

4.1 Use abbreviations only according to frequency

Very Often â†’ used by default

Often â†’ used regularly

Sometimes â†’ used only when it improves flow

Rare â†’ avoid unless context requires

Never â†’ do not use (kept for informational purposes)

4.2 Always expand meaning when unsure

If AI is not completely certain about the meaning â†’ use the full word.

Example:
If context is unclear â†’ write â€œcargoâ€ instead of cgo.

4.3 In formal emails:

Avoid over-use of abbreviations

Keep structure professional

Use only high-frequency abbreviations (Very Often, Often)

4.4 In WhatsApp / Teams messages:

Abbreviations can be used more aggressively

Communication is shorter and more direct

Still avoid abbreviations marked as Rare or Never

4.5 In reminder messages:

The tone may become shorter with each reminder

Abbreviations marked Very Often may appear more frequently

Meaning must always remain unambiguous
